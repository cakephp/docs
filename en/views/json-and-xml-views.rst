JSON and XML views
##################

The ``JsonView`` and ``XmlView``
let you easily create JSON and XML responses, and integrate with the
:php:class:`Cake\\Controller\\Component\\RequestHandlerComponent`.

By enabling ``RequestHandlerComponent`` in your application, and enabling
support for the ``json`` and or ``xml`` extensions, you can automatically
leverage the new view classes. ``JsonView`` and ``XmlView`` will be referred to
as data views for the rest of this page.

There are two ways you can generate data views. The first is by using the
``_serialize`` key, and the second is by creating normal template files.

Enabling Data Views in Your Application
=======================================

Before you can use the data view classes, you'll first need to load the
:php:class:`Cake\\Controller\\Component\\RequestHandlerComponent` in your
contoller::

    public function initialize()
    {
        ...
        $this->loadComponent('RequestHandler');
    }

This can be done in your `AppController` and will enable automatic view class
switching on content types. You can also set the component up with the
``viewClassMap`` setting, to map types to your custom classes and/or map other
data types.

You can optionally enable the json and or xml extensions with
:ref:`file-extensions`. This will allow you to access the ``JSON``, ``XML`` or
any other special format views by using a custom URL ending with the name of the
response type as a file extension such as ``http://example.com/articles.json``.

By default, when not enabling :ref:`file-extensions`, the request the ``Accept``
header is used for selecting which type of format should be rendered to the
user. An example ``Accept`` format that is used to render ``JSON`` responses is
``application/json``.

Using Data Views with the Serialize Key
=======================================

The ``_serialize`` key is a special view variable that indicates which other
view variable(s) should be serialized when using a data view. This lets you skip
defining template files for your controller actions if you don't need to do any
custom formatting before your data is converted into json/xml.

If you need to do any formatting or manipulation of your view variables before
generating the response, you should use template files. The value of
``_serialize`` can be either a string or an array of view variables to
serialize::

    namespace App\Controller;

    class ArticlesController extends AppController
    {
        public function initialize()
        {
            parent::initialize();
            $this->loadComponent('RequestHandler');
        }

        public function index()
        {
            // Set the view vars that have to be serialized.
            $this->set('articles', $this->paginate());
            // Specify which view vars JsonView should serialize.
            $this->set('_serialize', ['articles']);
        }
    }

You can also define ``_serialize`` as an array of view variables to combine::

    namespace App\Controller;

    class ArticlesController extends AppController
    {
        public function initialize()
        {
            parent::initialize();
            $this->loadComponent('RequestHandler');
        }

        public function index()
        {
            // Some code that created $articles and $comments
            
            // Set the view vars that have to be serialized.
            $this->set(compact('articles', 'comments'));
            
            // Specify which view vars JsonView should serialize.
            $this->set('_serialize', ['articles', 'comments']);
        }
    }

Defining ``_serialize`` as an array has the added benefit of automatically
appending a top-level ``<response>`` element when using :php:class:`XmlView`.
If you use a string value for ``_serialize`` and XmlView, make sure that your
view variable has a single top-level element. Without a single top-level
element the Xml will fail to generate.

.. versionadded:: 3.1.0

    You can also set ``_serialized`` to ``true`` to serialize all view variables
    instead of explicitly specifying them.

Using a Data View with Template Files
=====================================

You should use template files if you need to do some manipulation of your view
content before creating the final output. For example if we had articles, that had
a field containing generated HTML, we would probably want to omit that from a
JSON response. This is a situation where a view file would be useful::

    // Controller code
    class ArticlesController extends AppController
    {
        public function index()
        {
            $articles = $this->paginate('Articles');
            $this->set(compact('articles'));
        }
    }

    // View code - src/Template/Articles/json/index.ctp
    foreach ($articles as &$$article) {
        unset($article->generated_html);
    }
    echo json_encode(compact('articles'));

You can do more complex manipulations, or use helpers to do formatting as
well.

.. note::

    The data view classes don't support layouts. They assume that the view file
    will output the serialized content.

Creating XML Views
==================

.. php:class:: XmlView

By default when using ``_serialize`` the XmlView will wrap your serialized
view variables with a ``<response>`` node. You can set a custom name for
this node using the ``_rootNode`` view variable.

The XmlView class supports the ``_xmlOptions`` variable that allows you to
customize the options used to generate XML, e.g. ``tags`` vs ``attributes``.

Creating JSON Views
===================

.. php:class:: JsonView

The JsonView class supports the ``_jsonOptions`` variable that allows you to
customize the bit-mask used to generate JSON. See the
`json_encode <http://php.net/json_encode>`_ documentation for the valid
values of this option.

JSONP Responses
---------------

When using ``JsonView`` you can use the special view variable ``_jsonp`` to
enable returning a JSONP response. Setting it to ``true`` makes the view class
check if query string parameter named "callback" is set and if so wrap the json
response in the function name provided. If you want to use a custom query string
parameter name instead of "callback" set ``_jsonp`` to required name instead of
``true``.
