CakePHP Overview
################

Welcome to the Cookbook, the manual for the CakePHP web application
framework that makes developing a piece of cake!

This manual assumes that you have a general understanding of PHP
and a basic understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP).
Different functionality within the framework makes use of different
technologies – such as SQL, JavaScript, and XML – and this manual
does not attempt to explain those technologies, only how they are
used in context.
