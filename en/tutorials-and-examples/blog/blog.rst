Blog Tutorial
#############

Welcome to CakePHP. You're probably checking out this tutorial
because you want to learn more about how CakePHP works. It's our
aim to increase productivity and make coding more enjoyable: we
hope you'll see this as you dive into the code.

This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a simple blog
application. We'll be getting and installing CakePHP, creating and
configuring a database, and creating enough application logic to
list, add, edit, and delete blog posts.

Here's what you'll need:

#. A running web server. We're going to assume you're using Apache,
   though the instructions for using other servers should be very
   similar. We might have to play a little with the server
   configuration, but most folks can get CakePHP up and running without
   any configuration at all. Make sure you have PHP 5.4.19 or greater and also
   that ``mbstring`` and ``mcrypt`` extensions are enabled in PHP.
#. A database server. We're going to be using MySQL server in this
   tutorial. You'll need to know enough about SQL in order to create a
   database: CakePHP will be taking the reins from there. Since we're using MySQL,
   also make sure that you have ``pdo_mysql`` enabled in PHP.
#. Basic PHP knowledge. The more object-oriented programming you've
   done, the better: but fear not if you're a procedural fan.
#. Finally, you'll need a basic knowledge of the MVC programming pattern.
   A quick overview can be found in
   :doc:`/cakephp-overview/understanding-model-view-controller`.  Don't worry,
   it's only a half a page or so.

Let's get started!

Getting CakePHP
===============

The easiest way to get up and running is by downloading or cloning a fresh copy
from GitHub. To do this simply visit the CakePHP project on GitHub:
`http://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/releases <http://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/releases>`_
and download the latest release of CakePHP 3.0.

You can also install CakePHP using ``Composer``.
``Composer`` is a simple way of installing CakePHP from your terminal or
command line prompt. Simply type the following two lines in your terminal from
your webroot directory::

    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar create-project -s dev cakephp/app

This will download Composer and install the CakePHP application skeleton.
By default Composer will save your new project into a directory called ``app``.
Feel free to rename this directory to something which relates to your project,
e.g. ``blog``.

The advantage to using Composer is that it will automatically complete some
important set up tasks, such as setting the correct file permissions and
creating your app/Config/app.php file for you.

There are other ways to install CakePHP if you are uncomfortable with
``Composer``. For more information: check out the :doc:`/installation` section.

Regardless of how you downloaded and installed CakePHP, once your set up is
completed, your directory setup should look something like the following::

    /path_to_document_root
        /src
        /plugins
        /tests
        /tmp
        /vendor
        /webroot
        .gitignore
        .htaccess
        .travis.yml
        README.md
        composer.json
        index.php
        phpunit.xml.dist

Now might be a good time to learn a bit about how CakePHP's directory
structure works: check out the
:doc:`/getting-started/cakephp-folder-structure` section.

Directory Permissions on tmp
============================

You'll also need to set the proper permissions on the ``/tmp`` directory to make
it writable by your webserver. The best way to do this is to find out what user
your webserver runs as (``<?= `whoami`; ?>``) and change the ownership of
the ``tmp`` directory to that user. The final command you run (in \*nix)
might look something like this::

    $ chown -R www-data tmp

If for some reason CakePHP can't write to that directory, you'll be
informed by a warning while not in production mode.

While not recommended, if you are unable to set the permissions to the same as
your webserver, you can simply set write permissions on the folder by running a
command such as::

    $ chmod 777 -R tmp

Creating the Blog Database
==========================

Next, let's set up the underlying database for our blog. If you
haven't already done so, create an empty database for use in this
tutorial, with a name of your choice. Right now, we'll just create
a single table to store our articles. We'll also throw in a few articles
right now to use for testing purposes. Execute the following SQL
statements into your database::

    /* First, create our articles table: */
    CREATE TABLE articles (
        id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        title VARCHAR(50),
        body TEXT,
        created DATETIME DEFAULT NULL,
        modified DATETIME DEFAULT NULL
    );

    /* Then insert some articles for testing: */
    INSERT INTO articles (title,body,created)
        VALUES ('The title', 'This is the article body.', NOW());
    INSERT INTO articles (title,body,created)
        VALUES ('A title once again', 'And the article body follows.', NOW());
    INSERT INTO articles (title,body,created)
        VALUES ('Title strikes back', 'This is really exciting! Not.', NOW());

The choices on table and column names are not arbitrary. If you
follow CakePHP's database naming conventions, and CakePHP's class naming
conventions (both outlined in
:doc:`/getting-started/cakephp-conventions`), you'll be able to take
advantage of a lot of free functionality and avoid configuration.
CakePHP is flexible enough to accommodate even the worst legacy
database schema, but adhering to convention will save you time.

Check out :doc:`/getting-started/cakephp-conventions` for more
information, but it's suffice to say that naming our table 'articles'
automatically hooks it to our Articles model, and having fields called
'modified' and 'created' will be automagically managed by CakePHP.

Database Configuration
======================

Onward and upward: let's tell CakePHP where our database is and how to
connect to it. For many, this is the first and last time you
configure anything.

A copy of CakePHP's configuration file is found in
``src/Config/app.default.php``. Make a copy of this file in
the same directory, but name it ``app.php``.

The config file should be pretty straightforward: just replace the
values in the ``Datatsources.default`` array with those that apply to your
setup. A sample completed configuration array might look something
like the following::

    $config = [
        // More configuration above.
        'Datasources' => [
            'default' => [
                'className' => 'Cake\Database\Connection',
                'driver' => 'Cake\Database\Driver\Mysql',
                'persistent' => false,
                'host' => 'localhost',
                'login' => 'cake_blog',
                'password' => 'AngelF00dC4k3~',
                'database' => 'cake_blog',
                'prefix' => false,
                'encoding' => 'utf8',
                'timezone' => 'UTC'
            ],
        ],
        // More configuration below.
    ];

Once you've saved your new ``app.php`` file, you should be
able to open your browser and see the CakePHP welcome page. It should
also tell you that your database connection file was found, and
that CakePHP can successfully connect to the database.

.. note::

    Remember that you'll need to have PDO, and pdo_mysql enabled in
    your php.ini.

Optional Configuration
======================

There are a few other items that can be configured. Most developers
complete these laundry-list items, but they're not required for
this tutorial. One is defining a custom string (or "salt") for use
in security hashes.

The security salt is used for generating hashes. Change the default
salt value by editing ``/src/Config/app.php``. It doesn't
much matter what the new value is, as long as it's not easily
guessed::

    'Security' => [
        'salt' => 'something long and containing lots of different values.',
    ],


A Note on mod\_rewrite
======================

Occasionally new users will run into mod\_rewrite issues. For example
if the CakePHP welcome page looks a little funny (no images or CSS styles),
it probably means mod\_rewrite is not functioning on your system. Please refer
to one of the sections below about URL rewriting for your webserver to get
you up and running:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    /installation/url-rewriting


#. For some reason or another, you might have obtained a copy of
   CakePHP without the needed .htaccess files. This sometimes happens
   because some operating systems treat files that start with '.' as
   hidden, and don't copy them. Make sure your copy of CakePHP is from
   the downloads section of the site or our GitHub repository.

#. Make sure Apache is loading up mod\_rewrite correctly! You
   should see something like::

       LoadModule rewrite_module             libexec/httpd/mod_rewrite.so

   or (for Apache 1.3)::

       AddModule             mod_rewrite.c

   in your httpd.conf.


If you don't want or can't get mod\_rewrite (or some other
compatible module) up and running on your server, you'll need to
use CakePHP's built in pretty URLs. In ``/src/Config/app.php``,
uncomment the line that looks like::

    'App' => [
        // ...
        // 'baseUrl' => env('SCRIPT_NAME'),
    ]

Also remove these .htaccess files::

    /.htaccess
    webroot/.htaccess


This will make your URLs look like
www.example.com/index.php/controllername/actionname/param rather
than www.example.com/controllername/actionname/param.

If you are installing CakePHP on a webserver besides Apache, you
can find instructions for getting URL rewriting working for other
servers under the :doc:`/installation/url-rewriting` section.

Now continue to :doc:`/tutorials-and-examples/blog/part-two` to start building
your first CakePHP application.
