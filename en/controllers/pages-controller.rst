The Pages Controller
####################

CakePHP's official skeleton app ships with a default controller **PagesController.php**.
This is a simple and optional controller for serving up static content. The home page
you see after installation is generated using this controller and the view 
file **src/Template/Pages/home.ctp**. If you make the view file
**src/Template/Pages/about_us.ctp** you can access it using the URL
**http://example.com/pages/about_us**. You are free to modify the Pages
Controller to meet your needs.

When you "bake" an app using Composer the Pages Controller is created in your
**src/Controller/** folder.
