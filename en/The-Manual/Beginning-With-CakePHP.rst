Beginning With CakePHP
######################

Welcome to the Cookbook, the manual for the CakePHP web application
framework that makes developing a piece of cake!

This manual assumes that you have a general understanding of PHP and a
basic understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP). Different
functionality within the framework makes use of different technologies –
such as SQL, JavaScript, and XML – and this manual does not attempt to
explain those technologies, only how they are used in context.
