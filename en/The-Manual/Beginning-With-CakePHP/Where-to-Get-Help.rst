Where to Get Help
#################

The Official CakePHP website
============================

`https://cakephp.org <https://cakephp.org>`_

The Official CakePHP website is always a great place to visit. It
features links to oft-used developer tools, screencasts, donation
opportunities, and downloads.

The Cookbook
============

`https://book.cakephp.org </>`_

This manual should probably be the first place you go to get answers. As
with many other open source projects, we get new folks regularly. Try
your best to answer your questions on your own first. Answers may come
slower, but will remain longer – and you'll also be lightening our
support load. Both the manual and the API have an online component.

The Bakery
==========

`https://bakery.cakephp.org <https://bakery.cakephp.org>`_

The CakePHP Bakery is a clearing house for all things CakePHP. Check it
out for tutorials, case studies, and code examples. Once you’re
acquainted with CakePHP, log on and share your knowledge with the
community and gain instant fame and fortune.

The API
=======

`https://api.cakephp.org/ <https://api.cakephp.org/>`_

Straight to the point and straight from the core developers, the CakePHP
API (Application Programming Interface) is the most comprehensive
documentation around for all the nitty gritty details of the internal
workings of the framework. It's a straight forward code reference, so
bring your propeller hat.

CakeForge
=========

CakeForge was a developer resource that could be used to host CakePHP
projects to share with others. It has been discontinued and taken
offline in early 2011. If you have a CakePHP project that you would like
to share with the world, try a site like
`github <http://www.github.com/>`_.

The Test Cases
==============

`https://api.cakephp.org/tests <https://api.cakephp.org/tests>`_

If you ever feel the information provided in the API is not sufficient,
check out the code of the test cases provided with CakePHP 1.3. They can
serve as practical examples for function and data member usage for a
class. To get the core test cases you need to download or checkout 1.3
branch from a git repository. The test cases will be located under
cake/tests/cases

The IRC channel
===============

**IRC Channels on irc.freenode.net:**

-  `#cakephp <irc://irc.freenode.net/cakephp>`_ -- General Discussion
-  `#cakephp-docs <irc://irc.freenode.net/cakephp-docs>`_ --
   Documentation
-  `#cakephp-bakery <irc://irc.freenode.net/cakephp-bakery>`_ -- Bakery

If you’re stumped, give us a holler in the CakePHP IRC channel. Someone
from the development team is usually there, especially during the
daylight hours for North and South America users. We’d love to hear from
you, whether you need some help, want to find users in your area, or
would like to donate your brand new sports car.

The Google Group
================

`http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php <http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php>`_

CakePHP also has a very active Google Group. It can be a great resource
for finding archived answers, frequently asked questions, and getting
answers to immediate problems.
