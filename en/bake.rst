Bake Console
############

CakePHP's bake console is another effort to get you up and running in CakePHP
– fast. The bake console can create any of CakePHP's basic ingredients: models,
behaviors, views, helpers, controllers, components, test cases, fixtures and plugins.
And we aren't just talking skeleton classes: Bake can create a fully functional
application in just a few minutes. In fact, Bake is a natural step to take once
an application has been scaffolded.

Installation
============

Before trying to use or extend bake, make sure it is installed in your
application. Bake is provided as a plugin that you can install with Composer::

    composer require --dev cakephp/bake:~1.0

The above will install bake as a development dependency. This means that it will
not be installed when you do production deployments. 

When using the Twig templates make sure you are loading the ``WyriHaximus/TwigView`` plugin with its bootstrap.
You can also omit it completely which then makes Bake plugin load this plugin on demand.

For ``Plugin::loadAll()`` you must include ``'WyriHaximus/TwigView' => ['bootstrap' => true]``.
