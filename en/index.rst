Welcome
#######

The CakePHP cookbook, is an openly developed community editable documentation
project.  We hope to maintain a high level of quality, validity and accuracy for 
the documetation.

Getting started
===============

Build a blog
------------

Get started with the :doc:`blog tutorial</tutorials-and-examples/blog/blog>`.
You'll learn the basics of CakePHP, and build a basic blog in the process.

Conventions
-----------

Learn about a typical :doc:`CakePHP request
</getting-started/a-typical-cakephp-request>` and the :doc:`conventions
</getting-started/cakephp-conventions>` that power CakePHP.

Controllers
-----------

Controllers handle requests, and help co-ordinate and prepare
the response for the client.  Read more about :doc:`/controllers`

Views
-----

Views are the presentation layer in CakePHP.  They convert
the data fetched from Models, into the output format the client
requested.  Read more about :doc:`/views`

Models
------

Models are the heart of your application, they handle the validation,
storage and retrival of your data.  Read more about :doc:`/models`

Getting Help

If you're stuck, there are a number of places :doc:`you can get help
</cakephp-overview/where-to-get-help>`

Contributing
============

Contributing to the documentation is simple.  The files are hosted on
http://github.com/cakephp/docs.  Feel free to fork the repo, add your
changes/improvements/translations and give back by issuing a pull request.
You can even edit the docs online with github, without ever downloading the
files.

Translations
------------

Email the docs team (docs at cakephp dot org) or hop on IRC
(#cakephp on freenode) to discuss any translation efforts you would
like to participate in.

Translator tips:

- Browse and edit in the language you want the content to be
  translated to - otherwise you won't see what has already been
  translated.
- Feel free to dive right in if your chosen language already
  exists on the book.
- Use the to do list (top right) to see where attention is needed
  for your language.
- Use `Informal Form <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(linguistics)>`_.
- Translate both the content and the title at the same time.
- Do compare to the English content before submitting a correction
  (if you correct something, but don't integrate an 'upstream' change
  your submission won't be accepted).
- If you need to write an English term, wrap it in ``<em>`` tags.
  E.g. "asdf asdf *Controller* asdf" or "asdf asdf Kontroller
  (*Controller*) asfd" as appropriate.
- Do not submit partial translations.
- Do not edit a section with a pending change.
- Do not use
  `html entities <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references>`_
  for accented characters, the book uses UTF-8.
- Do not significantly change the markup (HTML) or add new content
- If the original content is missing some info, submit an edit for
  that first.
