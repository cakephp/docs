Getting Help
============

If you're stuck, there are a number of places :doc:`you can get help
</intro/where-to-get-help>`.

First Steps
===========

Learning a new framework can be intimidating and exciting at the same time. To
help you along, we have created a cookbook packed with examples and recipes to
get the common tasks completed. If you are new, you should start off with the
:doc:`/quickstart` as it will give you a quick tour of what
CakePHP has to offer and how it works.

After you've finished the Bookmarker Tutorial, you can brush up on the key
elements in a CakePHP application:

* The :ref:`CakePHP request cycle <request-cycle>`
* The :doc:`conventions <intro/conventions>` that CakePHP
  uses.
* :doc:`Controllers </controllers>` handle requests and co-ordinate your models
  and the responses your application creates.
* :doc:`Views </views>` are the presentation layer in your application. They
  give you powerful tools to create HTML, JSON and the other outputs your
  application needs.
* :doc:`Models </orm>` are the key ingredient in any application. They handle
  validation, and domain logic within your application.
