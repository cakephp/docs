App Class
#########

.. php:namespace:: Cake\Core

.. php:class:: App

The App class is responsible for resource location and path management.

Finding classes
===============

.. php:staticmethod:: classname($name, $type = '', $suffix = '')

    This method is used to resolve classnames throughout CakePHP. It resolves
    the short form names CakePHP uses and returns the fully resolved classname::

        // Resolve a short classname with the namespace + suffix
        App::classname('Auth', 'Controller/Component', 'Component');
        // Returns Cake\Controller\Component\AuthComponent

        // Resolve a plugin name.
        App::classname('DebugKit.Toolbar', 'Controller/Component', 'Component');
        // Returns DebugKit\Controller\Component\ToolbarComponent

        // Names with \ in them will be returned unaltered.
        App::classname('App\Cache\ComboCache');
        // Returns App\Cache\ComboCache

    When resolving classes, the ``App`` namespace will be tried, and if the
    class does not exist the ``Cake`` namespace will be attempted. If both
    classnames do not exist, ``false`` will be returned.

Finding paths to namespaces
===========================

.. php:staticmethod:: path(string $package, string $plugin = null)

    :rtype: array

    Used to get locations for paths based on conventions::

        // Get the path to Controller/ in your application
        App::path('Controller');

    This can be done for all namespaces that are part of your application. You
    can also fetch paths for a plugin::

        // return the component paths in DebugKit
        App::path('Component', 'DebugKit');

    ``App::path()`` will only return the default path, and will not be able to
    provide any information about additional paths the autoloader is configured
    for.

.. php:staticmethod:: core(string $package)

    :rtype: array

    Used for finding the path to a package inside CakePHP::

        // Get the path to Cache engines.
        App::core('Cache/Engine');


Finding which objects CakePHP knows about
=========================================

.. php:staticmethod:: objects(string $type, mixed $path = null, boolean $cache = true)

    :rtype: mixed Returns an array of objects of the given type or false if incorrect.

    You can find out which objects App knows about using
    ``App::objects('Controller')`` for example to find which application controllers
    App knows about.

    Example usage::

        //returns array('DebugKit', 'Blog', 'User');
        App::objects('plugin');

        // returns array('PagesController', 'BlogController');
        App::objects('Controller');

    You can also search only within a plugin's objects by using the plugin dot syntax.::

        // returns array('MyPluginPost', 'MyPluginComment');
        App::objects('MyPlugin.Model');


Locating plugins
================

.. php:staticmethod:: pluginPath(string $plugin)

    :rtype: string

    Plugins can be located with App as well. Using ``App::pluginPath('DebugKit');``
    for example, will give you the full path to the DebugKit plugin::

        $path = App::pluginPath('DebugKit');

Locating themes
===============

.. php:staticmethod:: themePath(string $theme)

    :rtype: string

    Themes can be found ``App::themePath('purple');``, would give the full path to the
    `purple` theme.

Overriding classes in CakePHP
=============================

You can override almost every class in the framework, exceptions are the
:php:class:`Cake\\Core\\App` and :php:class:`Cake\\Core\\Configure` classes. Whenever you like to
perform such overriding, just add your class to your app/Lib folder mimicking
the internal structure of the framework.  Some examples to follow

* To override the :php:class:`Dispatcher` class, create ``App/Routing/Dispatcher.php``
* To override the :php:class:`CakeRoute` class, create ``App/Routing/Route/CakeRoute.php``

When you load the replaced files, the App/files will be loaded instead of
the built-in core classes.

Loading Vendor Files
====================

Ideally vendor files should be autoloaded with ``composer``, if you have vendor
files that cannot be autoloaded or installed with composer you will need to use
``require`` to load them.

If you cannot install a library with composer, it is best to install each library in
a directory following composer's convention of ``vendor/$author/$package``.
If you had a library called AcmeLib, you could install it into
``/vendor/Acme/AcmeLib``. Assuming it did not use PSR-0 compatible classnames
you could autoload the classes within it using ``classmap`` in your
application's ``composer.json``::

    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": {
            "App\\": ".",
            ".": "./Plugin"
        },
        "classmap": [
            "vendor/Acme/AcmeLib"
        ]
    }

If your vendor library does not use classes, and instead provides functions, you
can configure composer to load these files at the beginning of each request
using the ``files`` autoloading strategy::

    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": {
            "App\\": ".",
            ".": "./Plugin"
        },
        "files": [
            "vendor/Acme/AcmeLib/functions.php"
        ]
    }

After configuring the vendor libraries you will need to regenerate your
application's autoloader using::

    $ php composer.phar dump-autoload

If you happen to not be using composer in your application, you will need to
manually load all vendor libraries yourself.


App Init/Load/Shutdown Methods
==============================

.. php:staticmethod:: init( )

    :rtype: void

    Initializes the cache for App, registers a shutdown function.

.. php:staticmethod:: shutdown( )

    :rtype: void

    Object destructor. Writes cache file if changes have been made to the
    ``$_objects``.
