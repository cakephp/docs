Plugins
#######

CakePHP allows you to set up a combination of controllers, models,
and views and release them as a packaged application plugin that
others can use in their CakePHP applications. Have a sweet user
management module, simple blog, or web services module in one of
your applications? Package it as a CakePHP plugin so you can pop it
into other applications.

The main tie between a plugin and the application it has been
installed into, is the application's configuration (database
connection, etc.). Otherwise, it operates in its own little space,
behaving much like it would if it were an application on its own.

Installing a Plugin
===================

To install a plugin, start by simply dropping the plugin folder in 
your app/Plugin folder. If you're installing a plugin named 
'ContactManager' then you should have a folder in app/Plugin
named 'ContactManager' under which are the plugin's View, Model, 
Controller, webroot, and any other directories.

New for CakePHP 2.0, plugins need to be loaded manually in 
app/Config/bootstrap.php.

You can either load them one by one or all of them in a single call::

    CakePlugin::loadAll(); // Loads all plugins at once
    CakePlugin::load('ContactManager'); //Loads a single plugin


loadAll loads all plugins available, while allowing you to set certain
settings for specific plugins. ``load()`` works similarly, but only loads the 
plugins you explicitly specify.

Plugin configuration
====================

There is a lot you can do with the load and loadAll methods to help with
plugin configuration and routing. Perhaps you want to load all plugins 
automatically, while specifying custom routes and bootstrap files for
certain plugins.

No problem::

    CakePlugin::loadAll(array(
        'Blog' => array('routes' => true),
        'ContactManager' => array('bootstrap' => true),
        'WebmasterTools' => array('bootstrap' => true, 'routes' => true),
    ));

With this style of configuration, you no longer need to manually 
include() or require() a plugin's configuration or routes file--It happens 
automatically at the right time and place. The exact same parameters could 
have also been supplied to the load() method, which would have loaded only those
three plugins, and not the rest.

Finally, you can also specify a set of defaults for loadAll which will apply to
every plugin that doesn't have a more specific configuration.

Load the bootstrap file from all plugins, and the routes from the Blog plugin::
    
    CakePlugin::loadAll(array(
        array('bootstrap' => true),
        'Blog' => array('routes' => true)
    ));


Note that all files specified should actually exist in the configured 
plugin(s) or PHP will give warnings for each file it cannot load. This is
especially important to remember when specifying defaults for all plugins.

Some plugins additionally need to create one or more tables in your database. In
those cases, they will often include a schema file which you can
call from the cake shell like this::

    user@host$ cake schema create --plugin ContactManager

Most plugins will indicate the proper procedure for configuring
them and setting up the database in their documentation. Some
plugins will require more setup than others.

Advanced bootstrapping
======================

If you like to load more than one bootstrap file for a plugin. You can specify
an array of files for the bootstrap configuration key::

    CakePlugin::loadAll(array(
        'Blog' => array(
            'bootstrap' => array(
                'config1',
                'config2'
            )
        )
    ));

You can also specify a callable function that needs to be called when the plugin
has been loaded::


    function aCallableFunction($pluginName, $config) {
        
    }

    CakePlugin::loadAll(array(
        'Blog' => array(
            'bootstrap' => 'aCallableFunction'
        )
    ));

Using a Plugin
==============

You can reference a plugin's controllers, models, components, 
behaviors, and helpers by prefixing the name of the plugin before
the class name.

For example, say you wanted to use the ContactManager plugin's
ContactInfoHelper to output some pretty contact information in
one of your views. In your controller, your $helpers array
could look like this::

    public $helpers = array('ContactManager.ContactInfo');

You would then be able to access the ContactInfoHelper just like
any other helper in your view, such as::

    echo $this->ContactInfo->address($contact);


Creating Your Own Plugins
=========================

As a working example, let's begin to create the ContactManager
plugin referenced above. To start out, we'll set up our plugin's
basic directory structure. It should look like this::

    /app
        /Plugin
            /ContactManager
                /Controller
                    /Component
                /Model
                    /Behavior
                /View
                    /Helper
                    /Layouts
                    
Note the name of the plugin folder, '**ContactManager**'. It is important
that this folder has the same name as the plugin.

Inside the plugin folder, you'll notice it looks a lot like a CakePHP
application, and that's basically what it is. You don't actually have to
include any of those folders if you do not use them. Some plugins might
only define a Component and a Behavior, and in that case they can completely
omit the 'View' directory.

A plugin can also have basically any of the other directories that your 
application can, such as Config, Console, Lib, webroot, etc.

.. note::

    If you want to be able to access your plugin with a URL, defining
    an AppController and AppModel for the plugin is required. These 
    two special classes are named after the plugin, and extend the 
    parent application's AppController and AppModel. Here's what they 
    should look like for our ContactManager example:

::

    // /app/Plugin/ContactManager/Controller/ContactManagerAppController.php:
    class ContactManagerAppController extends AppController {
    }

::

    // /app/Plugin/ContactManager/Model/ContactManagerAppModel.php:
    class ContactManagerAppModel extends AppModel {
    }

If you forgot to define these special classes, CakePHP will hand
you "Missing Controller" errors until you've done so.

Please note that the process of creating plugins can be greatly
simplified by using the Cake shell.

In order to bake a plugin please use the following command::

    user@host$ cake bake plugin ContactManager

Now you can bake using the same conventions which apply to the rest
of your app. For example - baking controllers::

    user@host$ cake bake controller Contacts --plugin ContactManager

Please refer to the chapter
:doc:`/console-and-shells/code-generation-with-bake` if you
have any problems with using the command line.


Plugin Controllers
==================

Controllers for our ContactManager plugin will be stored in
/app/Plugin/ContactManager/Controller/. Since the main thing we'll 
be doing is managing contacts, we'll need a ContactsController for 
this plugin.

So, we place our new ContactsController in
/app/Plugin/ContactManager/Controller and it looks like so::

    // app/Plugin/ContactManager/Controller/ContactsController.php
    class ContactsController extends ContactManagerAppController {
        public $uses = array('ContactManager.Contact');

        public function index() {
            //...
        }
    }

.. note::

    This controller extends the plugin's AppController (called
    ContactManagerAppController) rather than the parent application's
    AppController.

    Also note how the name of the model is prefixed with the name of
    the plugin. This is required to differentiate between models in 
    the plugin and models in the main application.

    In this case, the $uses array would not be required as 
    ContactManager.Contact would be the default model for this
    controller, however it is included to demonstrate how to
    properly prepend the plugin name.

If you want to access what we've got going thus far, visit
/contact_manager/contacts. You should get a "Missing Model" error
because we don't have a Contact model defined yet.

.. _plugin-models:

Plugin Models
=============

Models for the plugin are stored in /app/Plugin/ContactManager/Model.
We've already defined a ContactsController for this plugin, so let's 
create the model for that controller, called Contact::

    // /app/Plugin/ContactManager/Model/Contact.php:
    class Contact extends ContactManagerAppModel {
    }

Visiting /contact_manager/contacts now (given you've got a table in your
database called 'contacts') should give us a "Missing View" error. 
Let's create that next.

.. note::

    If you need to reference a model within your plugin, you need to
    include the plugin name with the model name, separated with a dot.

For example::

    // /app/Plugin/ContactManager/Model/Contact.php:
    class Contact extends ContactManagerAppModel {
        public $hasMany = array('ContactManager.AltName');
    }

If you would prefer that the array keys for the association not
have the plugin prefix on them, use the alternative syntax::

    // /app/Plugin/ContactManager/Model/Contact.php:
    class Contact extends ContactManagerAppModel {
        public $hasMany = array(
            'AltName' => array(
                'className' => 'ContactManager.AltName'
            )
        );
    }

Plugin Views
============

Views behave exactly as they do in normal applications. Just place
them in the right folder inside of the /app/Plugin/[PluginName]/View/
folder. For our ContactManager plugin, we'll need a view for our
ContactsController::index() action, so let's include that as
well::

    // /app/Plugin/ContactManager/View/Contacts/index.ctp:
    <h1>Contacts</h1>
    <p>Following is a sortable list of your contacts</p>
    <!-- A sortable list of contacts would go here....-->

.. note::

    For information on how to use elements from a plugin, look up
    :ref:`view-elements`

Overriding plugin views from inside your application
----------------------------------------------------

You can override any plugin views from inside your app using
special paths. If you have a plugin called 'ContactManager' you 
can override the view files of the plugin with more application 
specific view logic by creating files using the following template
"app/View/Plugin/[Plugin]/[Controller]/[view].ctp". For the 
Contacts controller you could make the following file::

    /app/View/Plugin/ContactManager/Contacts/index.ctp

Creating this file, would allow you to override
"/app/Plugin/ContactManager/View/Contacts/index.ctp".

.. _plugin-assets:


Plugin assets
=============

A plugin's web assets (but not PHP files) can be served through the 
plugin's 'webroot' directory, just like the main application's assets::

    app/Plugin/ContactManager/webroot/
                                        css/
                                        js/
                                        img/
                                        flash/
                                        pdf/

You may put any type of file in any directory, just like a regular 
webroot.

But keep in mind that handling static assets, such as images, Javascript
and CSS files of plugins, through the Dispatcher is incredibly inefficient.
It is strongly recommended to symlink them for production.
For example like this::

    ln -s app/Plugin/YourPlugin/webroot/css/yourplugin.css app/webroot/css/yourplugin.css

Linking to assets in plugins
----------------------------

Simply prepend /plugin_name/ to the beginning of a request for an
asset within that plugin, and it will work as if the asset were
in your application's webroot.

For example, linking to '/contact_manager/js/some_file.js'
would serve the asset 
'app/Plugin/ContactManager/webroot/js/some_file.js'.

.. note::

    It is important to note the **/your_plugin/** prefix before the
    asset path. That makes the magic happen!

.. versionchanged:: 2.1
    Use :term:`plugin syntax` to request assets. For example in your View:
    <?php echo $this->Html->css("ContactManager.style"); ?>


Components, Helpers and Behaviors
=================================

A plugin can have Components, Helpers and Behaviors just like a
regular CakePHP application. You can even create plugins that
consist only of Components, Helpers or Behaviors which can be a 
great way to build reusable components that can easily be 
dropped into any project.

Building these components is exactly the same as building it within
a regular application, with no special naming convention.

Referring to your component from inside or outside of your plugin
requires only that you prefix the plugin name before the name of the
component. For example::

    // Component defined in 'ContactManager' plugin
    class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    }
    
    // within your controllers:
    public $components = array('ContactManager.Example'); 

The same technique applies to Helpers and Behaviors.

.. note::

    When creating Helpers you may find AppHelper is not automatically 
    available. You should declare the resources you need with Uses::
    
        // Declare use of AppHelper for your Plugin's Helper
        App::uses('AppHelper', 'View/Helper');

Expand Your Plugin
==================

This example created a good start for a plugin, but there is a lot
more that you can do. As a general rule, anything you can do with your
application, you can do inside of a plugin instead.

Go ahead, include some third-party libraries in 'Vendor', add some 
new shells to the cake console, and don't forget to create test cases 
so your plugin users can automatically test your plugin's functionality!

In our ContactManager example, we might create add/remove/edit/delete
actions in the ContactsController, implement validation in the Contact
model, and implement the functionality one might expect when managing
their contacts. It's up to you to decide what to implement in your
plugins. Just don't forget to share your code with the community so
that everyone can benefit from your awesome, reusable components!

Plugin Tips
===========

Once a plugin has been installed in /app/Plugin, you can access it
at the URL /plugin_name/controller_name/action. In our ContactManager
plugin example, we'd access our ContactsController at
/contact_manager/contacts.

Some final tips on working with plugins in your CakePHP
applications:


-  When you don't have a [Plugin]AppController and
   [Plugin]AppModel, you'll get missing Controller errors when trying
   to access a plugin controller.
-  You can define your own layouts for plugins, inside
   app/Plugin/[Plugin]/View/Layouts. Otherwise, plugins will use the
   layouts from the /app/View/Layouts folder by default.
-  You can do inter-plugin communication by using
   ``$this->requestAction('/plugin_name/controller_name/action');`` in your
   controllers.
-  If you use requestAction, make sure controller and model names
   are as unique as possible. Otherwise you might get PHP "redefined
   class ..." errors.
