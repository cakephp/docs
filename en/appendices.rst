Forwards Compatibility Shimming
===============================

FC shimming can prepare your 3.x app for the next major release (4.x).

If you already want to shim 4.x behavior in 3.x, check out
the `Shim plugin <https://github.com/dereuromark/cakephp-shim>`__ that can help mitigate some BC breaking changes.
The closer your 3.x app is to 4.x, the smaller will be the diff of changes, and the smoother will be the final upgrade.
