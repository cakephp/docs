Schema Cache Tool
#################

The SchemaCacheShell provides a simple CLI tool for managing your application's
metadata caches. In deployment situations it is helpful to rebuild the metadata
cache in-place without clearing the existing cache data. You can do this by
running:

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/cake schema_cache build --connection default

This will rebuild the metadata cache for all tables on the ``default``
connection. If you only need to rebuild a single table you can do that by
providing its name:

.. code-block:: bash

    bin/cake schema_cache build --connection default articles

In addition to building cached data, you can use the SchemaCacheShell to remove
cached metadata as well:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Clear all metadata
    bin/cake schema_cache clear

    # Clear a single table
    bin/cake schema_cache clear articles
