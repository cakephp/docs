Console & Shells
################

.. php:namespace:: Cake\Console

CakePHP features not only a web framework but also a console framework
for creating console applications. Console applications are ideal for handling
a variety of background tasks such as maintenance, and completing work outside
of the request-response cycle. CakePHP console applications allow you
to reuse your application classes from the command line.

CakePHP comes with a number of console applications out of the box.  Some of
these applications are used in concert with other CakePHP features (like i18n),
and others are for general use to get you working faster.

The CakePHP Console
===================

This section provides an introduction into CakePHP at the
command-line. Console tools are ideal for use in cron jobs, or command line
based utilities that don't need to be accessible from a web browser.

PHP provides a CLI client that makes interfacing with your
file system and applications much smoother. The CakePHP console
provides a framework for creating shell scripts. The Console uses a
dispatcher-type setup to load a shell or task, and provide its
parameters.

.. note::

    A command-line (CLI) build of PHP must be available on the system
    if you plan to use the Console.

Before we get into specifics, let's make sure you can run the CakePHP console.
First, you'll need to bring up a system shell. The examples shown in this
section will be in bash, but the CakePHP Console is Windows-compatible as well.
This example assumes that the user is currently logged into a bash prompt and is
currently at the root of a CakePHP application.

CakePHP applications contain a ``Console`` directory that contains all the
shells and tasks for an application. It also comes with an executable::

    $ cd /path/to/app
    $ bin/cake

.. note::

    For Windows, the command needs to be ``bin\cake`` (note the backslash).

Running the Console with no arguments produces this help message::

    Welcome to CakePHP v3.0.0 Console
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    App : App
    Path: /Users/markstory/Sites/cakephp-app/src/
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Current Paths:

     -app: src
     -root: /Users/markstory/Sites/cakephp-app
     -core: /Users/markstory/Sites/cakephp-app/vendor/cakephp/cakephp

    Changing Paths:

    Your working path should be the same as your application path. To change your path use the '-app' param.
    Example: -app relative/path/to/myapp or -app /absolute/path/to/myapp

    Available Shells:

    [Bake] bake

    [Migrations] migrations

    [CORE] i18n, orm_cache, plugin, routes, server

    [app] behavior_time, console, orm

    To run an app or core command, type cake shell_name [args]
    To run a plugin command, type cake Plugin.shell_name [args]
    To get help on a specific command, type cake shell_name --help

The first information printed relates to paths. This is helpful if you're
running the console from different parts of the filesystem.

You could then run the any of the listed shells by using its name::

    # run server shell
    bin/cake server

    # run migrations shell
    bin/cake migrations -h

    # run bake (with plugin prefix)
    bin/cake bake.bake -h

Plugin shells can be invoked without a plugin prefix if the shell's name does
not overlap with an application or framework shell. In the case that two plugins
provide a shell with the same name, the first loaded plugin will get the short
alias. You can always use the ``plugin.shell`` format to unambiguously reference
a shell.

.. php:class:: Shell

Creating a Shell
================

Let's create a shell for use in the Console. For this example,
we'll create a simple Hello world shell. In your application's
``Shell`` directory create ``HelloShell.php``. Put the following
code inside it::

    namespace App\Shell;

    use Cake\Console\Shell;

    class HelloShell extends Shell
    {
        public function main()
        {
            $this->out('Hello world.');
        }
    }

The conventions for shell classes are that the class name should match
the file name, with the suffix of Shell. In our shell we created a ``main()`` method.
This method is called when a shell is called with no additional commands. We'll add
some more commands in a bit, but for now let's just run our shell. From your application
directory, run::

    bin/cake hello

You should see the following output::

    Welcome to CakePHP Console
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    App : app
    Path: /Users/markstory/Sites/cake_dev/src/
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Hello world.

As mentioned before, the ``main()`` method in shells is a special method called
whenever there are no other commands or arguments given to a shell. Since our
main method wasn't very interesting let's add another command that does something::

    namespace App\Shell;

    use Cake\Console\Shell;

    class HelloShell extends Shell
    {
        public function main()
        {
            $this->out('Hello world.');
        }

        public function heyThere($name = 'Anonymous')
        {
            $this->out('Hey there ' . $name);
        }
    }

After saving this file, you should be able to run the following command and
see your name printed out::

    bin/cake hello hey_there your-name

Any public method not prefixed by an ``_`` is allowed to be called from the
command line. As you can see, methods invoked from the command line are
transformed from the underscored shell argument to the correct camel-cased
method name in the class.

In our ``heyThere()`` method we can see that positional arguments are provided to our
``heyThere()`` function. Positional arguments are also available in the ``args`` property.
You can access switches or options on shell applications, which are available at
``$this->params``, but we'll cover that in a bit.

When using a ``main()`` method you won't be able to use the positional
arguments. This is because the first positional argument or option is
interpreted as the command name. If you want to use arguments, you
should use method names other than ``main``.

Using Models in Your Shells
---------------------------

You'll often need access to your application's business logic in shell
utilities; CakePHP makes that super easy. You can load models in shells, just as
you would in a controller using ``loadModel()``. The loaded models are set as
properties attached to your shell::

    namespace App\Shell;

    use Cake\Console\Shell;

    class UserShell extends Shell
    {

        public function initialize()
        {
            parent::initialize();
            $this->loadModel('Users');
        }

        public function show()
        {
            if (empty($this->args[0])) {
                return $this->error('Please enter a username.');
            }
            $user = $this->Users->findByUsername($this->args[0]);
            $this->out(print_r($user, true));
        }
    }

The above shell, will fetch a user by username and display the information
stored in the database.

Shell Tasks
===========

There will be times when building more advanced console applications, you'll want
to compose functionality into re-usable classes that can be shared across many shells.
Tasks allow you to extract commands into classes. For example the ``bake`` is made
almost entirely of tasks. You define a tasks for a shell using the ``$tasks`` property::

    class UserShell extends Shell
    {
        public $tasks = ['Template'];
    }

You can use tasks from plugins using the standard :term:`plugin syntax`.
Tasks are stored in ``Shell/Task/`` in files named after their classes. So if
we were to create a new 'FileGenerator' task, you would create
**src/Shell/Task/FileGeneratorTask.php**.

Each task must at least implement a ``main()`` method. The ShellDispatcher,
will call this method when the task is invoked. A task class looks like::

    namespace App\Shell\Task;

    use Cake\Console\Shell;

    class FileGeneratorTask extends Shell
    {
        public function main()
        {

        }
    }

A shell can also access its tasks as properties, which makes tasks great for
making re-usable chunks of functionality similar to :doc:`/controllers/components`::

    // Found in src/Shell/SeaShell.php
    class SeaShell extends Shell
    {
        // Found in src/Shell/Task/SoundTask.php
        public $tasks = ['Sound'];

        public function main()
        {
            $this->Sound->main();
        }
    }

You can also access tasks directly from the command line::

    $ cake sea sound

.. note::

    In order to access tasks directly from the command line, the task
    **must** be included in the shell class' $tasks property.


Also, the task name must be added as a sub command to the Shell's
OptionParser::

    public function getOptionParser()
    {
        $parser = parent::getOptionParser();
        $parser->addSubcommand('sound', [
            'help' => 'Execute The Sound Task.'
        ]);
        return $parser;
    }

Loading Tasks On The Fly with TaskRegistry
------------------------------------------

You can load tasks on the fly using the Task registry object. You can load tasks that
were not declared in $tasks this way::

    $project = $this->Tasks->load('Project');

Would load and return a ProjectTask instance. You can load tasks from plugins using::

    $progressBar = $this->Tasks->load('ProgressBar.ProgressBar');

Shell Helpers
=============

If you have complex output generation logic, you can use
:doc:`/console-and-shells/helpers` to encapsulate this logic in a re-usable way.

.. _invoking-other-shells-from-your-shell:

Invoking Other Shells from Your Shell
=====================================

.. php:method:: dispatchShell($args)

There are still many cases where you will want to invoke one shell from another though.
``Shell::dispatchShell()`` gives you the ability to call other shells by providing the
``argv`` for the sub shell. You can provide arguments and options either
as var args or as a string::

    // As a string
    $this->dispatchShell('schema create Blog --plugin Blog');

    // As an array
    $this->dispatchShell('schema', 'create', 'Blog', '--plugin', 'Blog');

The above shows how you can call the schema shell to create the schema for a plugin
from inside your plugin's shell.

Passing extra parameters to the dispatched Shell
------------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.1

It can sometimes be useful to pass on extra parameters (that are not shell arguments)
to the dispatched Shell. In order to do this, you can now pass an array to
``dispatchShell()``. The array is expected to have a ``command`` key as well
as an ``extra`` key::

    // Using a command string
    $this->dispatchShell([
       'command' => 'schema create Blog --plugin Blog'
       'extra' => [
            'foo' => 'bar'
        ]
    ]);

    // Using a command array
    $this->dispatchShell([
       'command' => ['schema', 'create', 'Blog', '--plugin', 'Blog']
       'extra' => [
            'foo' => 'bar'
        ]
    ]);

Parameters passed through ``extra`` will be merged in the ``Shell::$params``
property and are accessible with the ``Shell::param()`` method.
By default, a ``requested`` extra param is automatically added when a Shell
is dispatched using ``dispatchShell()``. This ``requested`` parameter prevents
the CakePHP console welcome message from being displayed on dispatched shells.

Getting User Input
==================

.. php:method:: in($question, $choices = null, $defaut = null)

When building interactive console applications you'll need to get user input.
CakePHP provides an easy way to do this::

    // Get arbitrary text from the user.
    $color = $this->in('What color do you like?');

    // Get a choice from the user.
    $selection = $this->in('Red or Green?', ['R', 'G'], 'R');

Selection validation is case-insensitive.

Creating Files
==============

.. php:method:: createFile($path, $contents)

Many Shell applications help automate development or deployment tasks. Creating
files is often important in these use cases. CakePHP provides an easy way to
create a file at a given path::

    $this->createFile('bower.json', $stuff);

If the Shell is interactive, a warning will be generated, and the user asked if
they want to overwrite the file if it already exists.  If the shell's
interactive property is ``false``, no question will be asked and the file will
simply be overwritten.

Console Output
==============

.. php:method:out($message, $newlines, $level)
.. php:method:err($message, $newlines)

The ``Shell`` class provides a few methods for outputting content::

    // Write to stdout
    $this->out('Normal message');

    // Write to stderr
    $this->err('Error message');

    // Write to stderr and stop the process
    $this->error('Fatal error');

Shell also includes methods for clearing output, creating blank lines, or
drawing a line of dashes::

    // Output 2 newlines
    $this->out($this->nl(2));

    // Clear the user's screen
    $this->clear();

    // Draw a horizontal line
    $this->hr();

Lastly, you can update the current line of text on the screen using
``_io->overwrite()``::

    $this->out('Counting down');
    $this->out('10', 0);
    for ($i = 9; $i > 0; $i--) {
        sleep(1);
        $this->_io->overwrite($i, 0, 2);
    }

It is important to remember, that you cannot overwrite text
once a new line has been output.

.. _shell-output-level:

Console Output Levels
---------------------

Shells often need different levels of verbosity. When running as cron jobs,
most output is un-necessary. And there are times when you are not interested in
everything that a shell has to say. You can use output levels to flag output
appropriately. The user of the shell, can then decide what level of detail
they are interested in by setting the correct flag when calling the shell.
:php:meth:`Cake\\Console\\Shell::out()` supports 3 types of output by default.

* QUIET - Only absolutely important information should be marked for quiet output.
* NORMAL - The default level, and normal usage.
* VERBOSE - Mark messages that may be too noisy for everyday use, but helpful
  for debugging as VERBOSE.

You can mark output as follows::

    // Would appear at all levels.
    $this->out('Quiet message', 1, Shell::QUIET);
    $this->quiet('Quiet message');

    // Would not appear when quiet output is toggled.
    $this->out('normal message', 1, Shell::NORMAL);
    $this->out('loud message', 1, Shell::VERBOSE);
    $this->verbose('Verbose output');

    // Would only appear when verbose output is enabled.
    $this->out('extra message', 1, Shell::VERBOSE);
    $this->verbose('Verbose output');

You can control the output level of shells, by using the ``--quiet`` and ``--verbose``
options. These options are added by default, and allow you to consistently control
output levels inside your CakePHP shells.

Styling Output
--------------

Styling output is done by including tags - just like HTML - in your output.
ConsoleOutput will replace these tags with the correct ansi code sequence, or
remove the tags if you are on a console that doesn't support ansi codes. There
are several built-in styles, and you can create more. The built-in ones are

* ``error`` Error messages. Red text.
* ``warning`` Warning messages. Yellow text.
* ``info`` Informational messages. Cyan text.
* ``comment`` Additional text. Blue text.
* ``question`` Text that is a question, added automatically by shell.

You can create additional styles using ``$this->stdout->styles()``. To declare a
new output style you could do::

    $this->_io->styles('flashy', ['text' => 'magenta', 'blink' => true]);

This would then allow you to use a ``<flashy>`` tag in your shell output, and if ansi
colours are enabled, the following would be rendered as blinking magenta text
``$this->out('<flashy>Whoooa</flashy> Something went wrong');``. When defining
styles you can use the following colours for the ``text`` and ``background`` attributes:

* black
* red
* green
* yellow
* blue
* magenta
* cyan
* white

You can also use the following options as boolean switches, setting them to a
truthy value enables them.

* bold
* underline
* blink
* reverse

Adding a style makes it available on all instances of ConsoleOutput as well,
so you don't have to redeclare styles for both stdout and stderr objects.

Turning Off Colouring
---------------------

Although colouring is pretty awesome, there may be times when you want to turn it off,
or force it on::

    $this->_io->outputAs(ConsoleOutput::RAW);

The above will put the output object into raw output mode. In raw output mode,
no styling is done at all. There are three modes you can use.

* ``ConsoleOutput::RAW`` - Raw output, no styling or formatting will be done.
  This is a good mode to use if you are outputting XML or, want to debug why
  your styling isn't working.
* ``ConsoleOutput::PLAIN`` - Plain text output, known style tags will be stripped
  from the output.
* ``ConsoleOutput::COLOR`` - Output with color escape codes in place.

By default on \*nix systems ConsoleOutput objects default to colour output.
On Windows systems, plain output is the default unless the ``ANSICON`` environment
variable is present.

Hook Methods
============

.. php:method:: initialize()

    Initializes the Shell acts as constructor for subclasses allows
    configuration of tasks prior to shell execution.

.. php:method:: startup()

    Starts up the Shell and displays the welcome message. Allows for checking
    and configuring prior to command or main execution.

    Override this method if you want to remove the welcome information, or
    otherwise modify the pre-command flow.

Configuring Options and Generating Help
=======================================

.. php:class:: ConsoleOptionParser

``ConsoleOptionParser`` provides a command line option and
argument parser.

OptionParsers allow you to accomplish two goals at the same time.  First, they
allow you to define the options and arguments for your commands.  This allows
you to separate basic input validation and your console commands. Secondly, it
allows you to provide documentation, that is used to generate a well formatted
help file.

The console framework in CakePHP gets your shell's option parser by calling
``$this->getOptionParser()``. Overriding this method allows you to
configure the OptionParser to define the expected inputs of your shell.
You can also configure subcommand option parsers, which allow you to
have different option parsers for subcommands and tasks.
The ConsoleOptionParser implements a fluent interface and includes
methods for easily setting multiple options/arguments at once::

    public function getOptionParser()
    {
        $parser = parent::getOptionParser();
        // Configure parser
        return $parser;
    }

Configuring an Option Parser with the Fluent Interface
------------------------------------------------------

All of the methods that configure an option parser can be chained,
allowing you to define an entire option parser in one series of method calls::

    public function getOptionParser()
    {
        $parser = parent::getOptionParser();
        $parser->addArgument('type', [
            'help' => 'Either a full path or type of class.'
        ])->addArgument('className', [
            'help' => 'A CakePHP core class name (e.g: Component, HtmlHelper).'
        ])->addOption('method', [
            'short' => 'm',
            'help' => __('The specific method you want help on.')
        ])->description(__('Lookup doc block comments for classes in CakePHP.'));
        return $parser;
    }

The methods that allow chaining are:

- description()
- epilog()
- command()
- addArgument()
- addArguments()
- addOption()
- addOptions()
- addSubcommand()
- addSubcommands()

.. php:method:: description($text = null)

Gets or sets the description for the option parser. The description
displays above the argument and option information. By passing in
either an array or a string, you can set the value of the description.
Calling with no arguments will return the current value::

    // Set multiple lines at once
    $parser->description(['line one', 'line two']);

    // Read the current value
    $parser->description();

.. php:method:: epilog($text = null)

Gets or sets the epilog for the option parser. The epilog
is displayed after the argument and option information. By passing in
either an array or a string, you can set the value of the epilog.
Calling with no arguments will return the current value::

    // Set multiple lines at once
    $parser->epilog(['line one', 'line two']);

    // Read the current value
    $parser->epilog();

Adding Arguments
----------------

.. php:method:: addArgument($name, $params = [])

Positional arguments are frequently used in command line tools,
and ``ConsoleOptionParser`` allows you to define positional
arguments as well as make them required. You can add arguments
one at a time with ``$parser->addArgument();`` or multiple at once
with ``$parser->addArguments();``::

    $parser->addArgument('model', ['help' => 'The model to bake']);

You can use the following options when creating an argument:

* ``help`` The help text to display for this argument.
* ``required`` Whether this parameter is required.
* ``index`` The index for the arg, if left undefined the argument will be put
  onto the end of the arguments. If you define the same index twice the
  first option will be overwritten.
* ``choices`` An array of valid choices for this argument. If left empty all
  values are valid. An exception will be raised when parse() encounters an
  invalid value.

Arguments that have been marked as required will throw an exception when
parsing the command if they have been omitted. So you don't have to
handle that in your shell.

.. php:method:: addArguments(array $args)

If you have an array with multiple arguments you can use ``$parser->addArguments()``
to add multiple arguments at once. ::

    $parser->addArguments([
        'node' => ['help' => 'The node to create', 'required' => true],
        'parent' => ['help' => 'The parent node', 'required' => true]
    ]);

As with all the builder methods on ConsoleOptionParser, addArguments
can be used as part of a fluent method chain.

Validating Arguments
--------------------

When creating positional arguments, you can use the ``required`` flag, to
indicate that an argument must be present when a shell is called.
Additionally you can use ``choices`` to force an argument to
be from a list of valid choices::

    $parser->addArgument('type', [
        'help' => 'The type of node to interact with.',
        'required' => true,
        'choices' => ['aro', 'aco']
    ]);

The above will create an argument that is required and has validation
on the input. If the argument is either missing, or has an incorrect
value an exception will be raised and the shell will be stopped.

Adding Options
--------------

.. php:method:: addOption($name, $options = [])

Options or flags are also frequently used in command line tools.
``ConsoleOptionParser`` supports creating options
with both verbose and short aliases, supplying defaults
and creating boolean switches. Options are created with either
``$parser->addOption()`` or ``$parser->addOptions()``. ::

    $parser->addOption('connection', [
        'short' => 'c',
        'help' => 'connection',
        'default' => 'default',
    ]);

The above would allow you to use either ``cake myshell --connection=other``,
``cake myshell --connection other``, or ``cake myshell -c other``
when invoking the shell. You can also create boolean switches, these switches do not
consume values, and their presence just enables them in the
parsed parameters. ::

    $parser->addOption('no-commit', ['boolean' => true]);

With this option, when calling a shell like ``cake myshell --no-commit something``
the no-commit param would have a value of ``true``, and 'something'
would be a treated as a positional argument.
The built-in ``--help``, ``--verbose``, and ``--quiet`` options
use this feature.

When creating options you can use the following options to
define the behavior of the option:

* ``short`` - The single letter variant for this option, leave undefined for none.
* ``help`` - Help text for this option. Used when generating help for the option.
* ``default`` - The default value for this option. If not defined the default will be ``true``.
* ``boolean`` - The option uses no value, it's just a boolean switch.
  Defaults to ``false``.
* ``choices`` - An array of valid choices for this option. If left empty all
  values are valid. An exception will be raised when parse() encounters an invalid value.

.. php:method:: addOptions(array $options)

If you have an array with multiple options you can use ``$parser->addOptions()``
to add multiple options at once. ::

    $parser->addOptions([
        'node' => ['short' => 'n', 'help' => 'The node to create'],
        'parent' => ['short' => 'p', 'help' => 'The parent node']
    ]);

As with all the builder methods on ConsoleOptionParser, addOptions can be used
as part of a fluent method chain.

Validating Options
------------------

Options can be provided with a set of choices much like positional arguments
can be. When an option has defined choices, those are the only valid choices
for an option. All other values will raise an ``InvalidArgumentException``::

    $parser->addOption('accept', [
        'help' => 'What version to accept.',
        'choices' => ['working', 'theirs', 'mine']
    ]);

Using Boolean Options
---------------------

Options can be defined as boolean options, which are useful when you need to create
some flag options. Like options with defaults, boolean options always include
themselves into the parsed parameters. When the flags are present they are set
to ``true``, when they are absent they are set ot ``false``::

    $parser->addOption('verbose', [
        'help' => 'Enable verbose output.',
        'boolean' => true
    ]);

The following option would result in ``$this->params['verbose']`` always
being available. This lets you omit ``empty()`` or ``isset()``
checks for boolean flags::

    if ($this->params['verbose']) {
        // Do something.
    }

Since the boolean options are always defined as ``true`` or
``false`` you can omit additional check methods.

Adding Subcommands
------------------

.. php:method:: addSubcommand($name, $options = [])

Console applications are often made of subcommands, and these subcommands
may require special option parsing and have their own help. A perfect
example of this is ``bake``. Bake is made of many separate tasks that all
have their own help and options. ``ConsoleOptionParser`` allows you to
define subcommands and provide command specific option parsers so the
shell knows how to parse commands for its tasks::

    $parser->addSubcommand('model', [
        'help' => 'Bake a model',
        'parser' => $this->Model->getOptionParser()
    ]);

The above is an example of how you could provide help and a specialized
option parser for a shell's task. By calling the Task's ``getOptionParser()``
we don't have to duplicate the option parser generation, or mix concerns
in our shell. Adding subcommands in this way has two advantages.
First it lets your shell easily document its subcommands in the
generated help. It also gives easy access to the subcommand
help. With the above subcommand created you could call
``cake myshell --help`` and see the list of subcommands, and
also run ``cake myshell model --help`` to view the help for
just the model task.

.. note::

    Once your Shell defines subcommands, all subcommands must be explicitly
    defined.

When defining a subcommand you can use the following options:

* ``help`` - Help text for the subcommand.
* ``parser`` - A ConsoleOptionParser for the subcommand. This allows you
  to create method specific option parsers. When help is generated for a
  subcommand, if a parser is present it will be used. You can also
  supply the parser as an array that is compatible with
  :php:meth:`Cake\\Console\\ConsoleOptionParser::buildFromArray()`

Adding subcommands can be done as part of a fluent method chain.

Building a ConsoleOptionParser from an Array
--------------------------------------------

.. php:method:: buildFromArray($spec)

As previously mentioned, when creating subcommand option parsers,
you can define the parser spec as an array for that method. This can help
make building subcommand parsers easier, as everything is an array::

    $parser->addSubcommand('check', [
        'help' => __('Check the permissions between an ACO and ARO.'),
        'parser' => [
            'description' => [
                __("Use this command to grant ACL permissions. Once executed, the "),
                __("ARO specified (and its children, if any) will have ALLOW access "),
                __("to the specified ACO action (and the ACO's children, if any).")
            ],
            'arguments' => [
                'aro' => ['help' => __('ARO to check.'), 'required' => true],
                'aco' => ['help' => __('ACO to check.'), 'required' => true],
                'action' => ['help' => __('Action to check')]
            ]
        ]
    ]);

Inside the parser spec, you can define keys for ``arguments``, ``options``,
``description`` and ``epilog``. You cannot define ``subcommands`` inside an
array style builder. The values for arguments, and options, should follow the
format that :php:func:`Cake\\Console\\ConsoleOptionParser::addArguments()` and
:php:func:`Cake\\Console\\ConsoleOptionParser::addOptions()` use. You can also use
buildFromArray on its own, to build an option parser::

    public function getOptionParser()
    {
        return ConsoleOptionParser::buildFromArray([
            'description' => [
                __("Use this command to grant ACL permissions. Once executed, the "),
                __("ARO specified (and its children, if any) will have ALLOW access "),
                __("to the specified ACO action (and the ACO's children, if any).")
            ],
            'arguments' => [
                'aro' => ['help' => __('ARO to check.'), 'required' => true],
                'aco' => ['help' => __('ACO to check.'), 'required' => true],
                'action' => ['help' => __('Action to check')]
            ]
        ]);
    }

Merging ConsoleOptionParsers
----------------------------

.. php:method:: merge($spec)

When building a group command, you maybe want to combine several parsers for this::

    $parser->merge($anotherParser);

Note that the order of arguments for each parser must be the same, and that options must
also be compatible for it work. So do not use keys for different things.

Getting Help from Shells
------------------------

With the addition of ConsoleOptionParser getting help from shells is done
in a consistent and uniform way. By using the ``--help`` or -``h`` option you
can view the help for any core shell, and any shell that implements a ConsoleOptionParser::

    cake bake --help
    cake bake -h

Would both generate the help for bake. If the shell supports subcommands
you can get help for those in a similar fashion::

    cake bake model --help
    cake bake model -h

This would get you the help specific to bake's model task.

Getting Help as XML
-------------------

When building automated tools or development tools that need to interact
with CakePHP shells, it's nice to have help available in a machine parse-able
format. The ConsoleOptionParser can provide help in xml by setting an
additional argument::

    cake bake --help xml
    cake bake -h xml

The above would return an XML document with the generated help, options,
arguments and subcommands for the selected shell. A sample XML document
would look like:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <shell>
        <command>bake fixture</command>
        <description>Generate fixtures for use with the test suite. You can use
            `bake fixture all` to bake all fixtures.</description>
        <epilog>
            Omitting all arguments and options will enter into an interactive
            mode.
        </epilog>
        <subcommands/>
        <options>
            <option name="--help" short="-h" boolean="1">
                <default/>
                <choices/>
            </option>
            <option name="--verbose" short="-v" boolean="1">
                <default/>
                <choices/>
            </option>
            <option name="--quiet" short="-q" boolean="1">
                <default/>
                <choices/>
            </option>
            <option name="--count" short="-n" boolean="">
                <default>10</default>
                <choices/>
            </option>
            <option name="--connection" short="-c" boolean="">
                <default>default</default>
                <choices/>
            </option>
            <option name="--plugin" short="-p" boolean="">
                <default/>
                <choices/>
            </option>
            <option name="--records" short="-r" boolean="1">
                <default/>
                <choices/>
            </option>
        </options>
        <arguments>
            <argument name="name" help="Name of the fixture to bake.
                Can use Plugin.name to bake plugin fixtures." required="">
                <choices/>
            </argument>
        </arguments>
    </shell>

Routing in Shells / CLI
=======================

In command-line interface (CLI), specifically your shells and tasks, ``env('HTTP_HOST')`` and
other webbrowser specific environment variables are not set.

If you generate reports or send emails that make use of ``Router::url()`` those will contain
the default host ``http://localhost/``  and thus resulting in invalid URLs. In this case you need to
specify the domain manually.
You can do that using the Configure value ``App.fullBaseURL`` from your bootstrap or config, for example.

For sending emails, you should provide Email class with the host you want to send the email with::

    use Cake\Network\Email\Email;

    $email = new Email();
    $email->domain('www.example.org');

This asserts that the generated message IDs are valid and fit to the domain the emails are sent from.
