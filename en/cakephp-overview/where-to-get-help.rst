Where to Get Help
#################

The Official CakePHP website
============================

`https://cakephp.org <https://cakephp.org>`_

The Official CakePHP website is always a great place to visit. It features links
to oft-used developer tools, screencasts, donation opportunities, and downloads.

The Cookbook
============

`https://book.cakephp.org <https://book.cakephp.org>`_

This manual should probably be the first place you go to get answers. As with
many other open source projects, we get new folks regularly. Try your best to
answer your questions on your own first. Answers may come slower, but will
remain longer – and you'll also be lightening our support load. Both the manual
and the API have an online component.

The Bakery
==========

`https://bakery.cakephp.org <https://bakery.cakephp.org>`_

The CakePHP Bakery is a clearing house for all things regarding CakePHP.
Check it out for tutorials, case studies, and code examples. Once you're
acquainted with CakePHP, log on and share your knowledge with the community and
gain instant fame and fortune.

The API
=======

`https://api.cakephp.org/ <https://api.cakephp.org/>`_

Straight to the point and straight from the core developers, the CakePHP API
(Application Programming Interface) is the most comprehensive documentation
around for all the nitty gritty details of the internal workings of the
framework. It's a straight forward code reference, so bring your propeller hat.

The Test Cases
==============

If you ever feel the information provided in the API is not sufficient, check
out the code of the test cases provided with CakePHP. They can serve as
practical examples for function and data member usage for a class. ::

is usually there, especially during the daylight hours for North and South
America users. We'd love to hear from you, whether you need some help, want to
find users in your area, or would like to donate your brand new sports car.
