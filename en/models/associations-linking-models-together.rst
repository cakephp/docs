Associations: Linking Models Together
#####################################

One of the most powerful features of CakePHP is the ability to link
relational mapping provided by the model. In CakePHP, the links
between models are handled through associations.

Defining relations between different objects in your application
should be a natural process. For example: in a recipe database, a
recipe may have many reviews, reviews have a single author, and
authors may have many recipes. Defining the way these relations
work allows you to access your data in an intuitive and powerful
way.

The purpose of this section is to show you how to plan for, define,
and utilize associations between models in CakePHP.

While data can come from a variety of sources, the most common form
of storage in web applications is a relational database. Most of
what this section covers will be in that context.

For information on associations with Plugin models, see
:ref:`plugin-models`.

Relationship Types
------------------

The four association types in CakePHP are: hasOne, hasMany,
belongsTo, and hasAndBelongsToMany (HABTM).

============= ===================== =======================================
Relationship  Association Type      Example
============= ===================== =======================================
one to one    hasOne                A user has one profile.
------------- --------------------- ---------------------------------------
one to many   hasMany               A user can have multiple recipes.
------------- --------------------- ---------------------------------------
many to one   belongsTo             Many recipes belong to a user.
------------- --------------------- ---------------------------------------
many to many  hasAndBelongsToMany   Recipes have, and belong to many ingredients.
============= ===================== =======================================

Associations are defined by creating a class variable named after
the association you are defining. The class variable can sometimes
be as simple as a string, but can be as complete as a
multidimensional array used to define association specifics.

::

    class User extends AppModel {
        public $hasOne = 'Profile';
        public $hasMany = array(
            'Recipe' => array(
                'className' => 'Recipe',
                'conditions' => array('Recipe.approved' => '1'),
                'order' => 'Recipe.created DESC'
            )
        );
    }

In the above example, the first instance of the word 'Recipe' is
what is termed an 'Alias'. This is an identifier for the
relationship and can be anything you choose. Usually, you will
choose the same name as the class that it references. However,
**aliases for each model must be unique app wide**. For example it is
appropriate to have::

    class User extends AppModel {
        public $hasMany = array(
            'MyRecipe' => array(
                'className' => 'Recipe',
            )
        );
        public $hasAndBelongsToMany = array(
            'MemberOf' => array(
                'className' => 'Group',
            )
        );
    }

    class Group extends AppModel {
        public $hasMany = array(
            'MyRecipe' => array(
                'className' => 'Recipe',
            )
        );
        public $hasAndBelongsToMany = array(
            'Member' => array(
                'className' => 'User',
            )
        );
    }

but the following will not work well in all circumstances::

    class User extends AppModel {
        public $hasMany = array(
            'MyRecipe' => array(
                'className' => 'Recipe',
            )
        );
        public $hasAndBelongsToMany = array(
            'Member' => array(
                'className' => 'Group',
            )
        );
    }

    class Group extends AppModel {
        public $hasMany = array(
            'MyRecipe' => array(
                'className' => 'Recipe',
            )
        );
        public $hasAndBelongsToMany = array(
            'Member' => array(
                'className' => 'User',
            )
        );
    }

because here we have the alias 'Member' referring to both the User
(in Group) and the Group (in User) model in the HABTM associations.
Choosing non-unique names for model aliases across models can cause
unexpected behavior.

CakePHP will automatically create links between associated model
objects. So for example in your ``User`` model you can access the
``Recipe`` model as::

    $this->Recipe->someFunction();

Similarly in your controller you can access an associated model
simply by following your model associations::

    $this->User->Recipe->someFunction();

.. note::

    Remember that associations are defined 'one way'. If you define
    User hasMany Recipe that has no effect on the Recipe Model. You
    need to define Recipe belongsTo User to be able to access the User
    model from your Recipe model

hasOne
------

Let's set up a User model with a hasOne relationship to a Profile
model.

First, your database tables need to be keyed correctly. For a
hasOne relationship to work, one table has to contain a foreign key
that points to a record in the other. In this case the profiles
table will contain a field called user\_id. The basic pattern is:

**hasOne:** the *other* model contains the foreign key.

==================== ==================
Relation             Schema
==================== ==================
Apple hasOne Banana  bananas.apple\_id
-------------------- ------------------
User hasOne Profile  profiles.user\_id
-------------------- ------------------
Doctor hasOne Mentor mentors.doctor\_id
==================== ==================

.. note::

    It is not mandatory to follow CakePHP conventions, you can easily override
    the use of any foreignKey in your associations definitions. Nevertheless sticking
    to conventions will make your code less repetitive, easier to read and to maintain.

The User model file will be saved in /app/Model/User.php. To
define the 'User hasOne Profile' association, add the $hasOne
property to the model class. Remember to have a Profile model in
/app/Model/Profile.php, or the association won't work::

    class User extends AppModel {
        public $hasOne = 'Profile';
    }

There are two ways to describe this relationship in your model
files. The simplest method is to set the $hasOne attribute to a
string containing the classname of the associated model, as we've
done above.

If you need more control, you can define your associations using
array syntax. For example, you might want to limit the association
to include only certain records.

::

    class User extends AppModel {
        public $hasOne = array(
            'Profile' => array(
                'className' => 'Profile',
                'conditions' => array('Profile.published' => '1'),
                'dependent' => true
            )
        );
    }

Possible keys for hasOne association arrays include:


-  **className**: the classname of the model being associated to
   the current model. If you're defining a 'User hasOne Profile'
   relationship, the className key should equal 'Profile.'
-  **foreignKey**: the name of the foreign key found in the other
   model. This is especially handy if you need to define multiple
   hasOne relationships. The default value for this key is the
   underscored, singular name of the current model, suffixed with
   '\_id'. In the example above it would default to 'user\_id'.
-  **conditions**: an array of find() compatible conditions or SQL
   strings such as array('Profile.approved' => true)
-  **fields**: A list of fields to be retrieved when the associated
   model data is fetched. Returns all fields by default.
-  **order**: an array of find() compatible order clauses or SQL
   strings such as array('Profile.last_name' => 'ASC')
-  **dependent**: When the dependent key is set to true, and the
   model's delete() method is called with the cascade parameter set to
   true, associated model records are also deleted. In this case we
   set it true so that deleting a User will also delete her associated
   Profile.

Once this association has been defined, find operations on the User
model will also fetch a related Profile record if it exists::

    //Sample results from a $this->User->find() call.

    Array
    (
        [User] => Array
            (
                [id] => 121
                [name] => Gwoo the Kungwoo
                [created] => 2007-05-01 10:31:01
            )
        [Profile] => Array
            (
                [id] => 12
                [user_id] => 121
                [skill] => Baking Cakes
                [created] => 2007-05-01 10:31:01
            )
    )

belongsTo
---------

Now that we have Profile data access from the User model, let's
define a belongsTo association in the Profile model in order to get
access to related User data. The belongsTo association is a natural
complement to the hasOne and hasMany associations: it allows us to
see the data from the other direction.

When keying your database tables for a belongsTo relationship,
follow this convention:

**belongsTo:** the *current* model contains the foreign key.

======================= ==================
Relation                Schema
======================= ==================
Banana belongsTo Apple  bananas.apple\_id
----------------------- ------------------
Profile belongsTo User  profiles.user\_id
----------------------- ------------------
Mentor belongsTo Doctor mentors.doctor\_id
======================= ==================

.. tip::

    If a model(table) contains a foreign key, it belongsTo the other
    model(table).

We can define the belongsTo association in our Profile model at
/app/Model/Profile.php using the string syntax as follows::

    class Profile extends AppModel {
        public $belongsTo = 'User';
    }

We can also define a more specific relationship using array
syntax::

    class Profile extends AppModel {
        public $belongsTo = array(
            'User' => array(
                'className' => 'User',
                'foreignKey' => 'user_id'
            )
        );
    }

Possible keys for belongsTo association arrays include:


-  **className**: the classname of the model being associated to
   the current model. If you're defining a 'Profile belongsTo User'
   relationship, the className key should equal 'User.'
-  **foreignKey**: the name of the foreign key found in the current
   model. This is especially handy if you need to define multiple
   belongsTo relationships. The default value for this key is the
   underscored, singular name of the other model, suffixed with
   ``_id``.
-  **conditions**: an array of find() compatible conditions or SQL
   strings such as ``array('User.active' => true)``
-  **type**: the type of the join to use in the SQL query, default
   is LEFT which may not fit your needs in all situations, INNER may
   be helpful when you want everything from your main and associated
   models or nothing at all! (effective when used with some conditions
   of course).
   **(NB: type value is in lower case - i.e. left, inner)**
-  **fields**: A list of fields to be retrieved when the associated
   model data is fetched. Returns all fields by default.
-  **order**: an array of find() compatible order clauses or SQL
   strings such as ``array('User.username' => 'ASC')``
-  **counterCache**: If set to true the associated Model will
   automatically increase or decrease the
   "[singular\_model\_name]\_count" field in the foreign table
   whenever you do a ``save()`` or ``delete()``. If it's a string then it's the
   field name to use. The value in the counter field represents the
   number of related rows. You can also specify multiple counter caches
   by defining an array, see :ref:`multiple-counterCache`
-  **counterScope**: Optional conditions array to use for updating
   counter cache field.

Once this association has been defined, find operations on the
Profile model will also fetch a related User record if it exists::

    //Sample results from a $this->Profile->find() call.

    Array
    (
       [Profile] => Array
            (
                [id] => 12
                [user_id] => 121
                [skill] => Baking Cakes
                [created] => 2007-05-01 10:31:01
            )
        [User] => Array
            (
                [id] => 121
                [name] => Gwoo the Kungwoo
                [created] => 2007-05-01 10:31:01
            )
    )

hasMany
-------

Next step: defining a "User hasMany Comment" association. A hasMany
association will allow us to fetch a user's comments when we fetch
a User record.

When keying your database tables for a hasMany relationship, follow
this convention:

**hasMany:** the *other* model contains the foreign key.

======================= ==================
Relation                Schema
======================= ==================
User hasMany Comment    Comment.user\_id
----------------------- ------------------
Cake hasMany Virtue     Virtue.cake\_id
----------------------- ------------------
Product hasMany Option  Option.product\_id
======================= ==================

We can define the hasMany association in our User model at
/app/Model/User.php using the string syntax as follows::

    class User extends AppModel {
        public $hasMany = 'Comment';
    }

We can also define a more specific relationship using array
syntax::

    class User extends AppModel {
        public $hasMany = array(
            'Comment' => array(
                'className' => 'Comment',
                'foreignKey' => 'user_id',
                'conditions' => array('Comment.status' => '1'),
                'order' => 'Comment.created DESC',
                'limit' => '5',
                'dependent' => true
            )
        );
    }

Possible keys for hasMany association arrays include:


-  **className**: the classname of the model being associated to
   the current model. If you're defining a 'User hasMany Comment'
   relationship, the className key should equal 'Comment.'
-  **foreignKey**: the name of the foreign key found in the other
   model. This is especially handy if you need to define multiple
   hasMany relationships. The default value for this key is the
   underscored, singular name of the actual model, suffixed with
   '\_id'.
-  **conditions**: an array of find() compatible conditions or SQL
   strings such as array('Comment.visible' => true)
-  **order**:  an array of find() compatible order clauses or SQL
   strings such as array('Profile.last_name' => 'ASC')
-  **limit**: The maximum number of associated rows you want
   returned.
-  **offset**: The number of associated rows to skip over (given
   the current conditions and order) before fetching and associating.
-  **dependent**: When dependent is set to true, recursive model
   deletion is possible. In this example, Comment records will be
   deleted when their associated User record has been deleted.
-  **exclusive**: When exclusive is set to true, recursive model
   deletion does the delete with a deleteAll() call, instead of
   deleting each entity separately. This greatly improves performance,
   but may not be ideal for all circumstances.
-  **finderQuery**: A complete SQL query CakePHP can use to fetch
   associated model records. This should be used in situations that
   require very custom results.
   If a query you're building requires a reference to the associated
   model ID, use the special ``{$__cakeID__$}`` marker in the query.
   For example, if your Apple model hasMany Orange, the query should
   look something like this:
   ``SELECT Orange.* from oranges as Orange WHERE Orange.apple_id = {$__cakeID__$};``


Once this association has been defined, find operations on the User
model will also fetch related Comment records if they exist::

    //Sample results from a $this->User->find() call.

    Array
    (
        [User] => Array
            (
                [id] => 121
                [name] => Gwoo the Kungwoo
                [created] => 2007-05-01 10:31:01
            )
        [Comment] => Array
            (
                [0] => Array
                    (
                        [id] => 123
                        [user_id] => 121
                        [title] => On Gwoo the Kungwoo
                        [body] => The Kungwooness is not so Gwooish
                        [created] => 2006-05-01 10:31:01
                    )
                [1] => Array
                    (
                        [id] => 124
                        [user_id] => 121
                        [title] => More on Gwoo
                        [body] => But what of the 'Nut?
                        [created] => 2006-05-01 10:41:01
                    )
            )
    )

One thing to remember is that you'll need a complimentary Comment
belongsTo User association in order to get the data from both
directions. What we've outlined in this section empowers you to get
Comment data from the User. Adding the Comment belongsTo User
association in the Comment model empowers you to get User data from
the Comment model - completing the connection and allowing the flow
of information from either model's perspective.

counterCache - Cache your count()
---------------------------------

This function helps you cache the count of related data. Instead of
counting the records manually via ``find('count')``, the model
itself tracks any addition/deleting towards the associated
``$hasMany`` model and increases/decreases a dedicated integer
field within the parent model table.

The name of the field consists of the singular model name followed
by a underscore and the word "count"::

    my_model_count

Let's say you have a model called ``ImageComment`` and a model
called ``Image``, you would add a new INT-field to the ``images``
table and name it ``image_comment_count``.

Here are some more examples:

========== ======================= =========================================
Model      Associated Model        Example
========== ======================= =========================================
User       Image                   users.image\_count
---------- ----------------------- -----------------------------------------
Image      ImageComment            images.image\_comment\_count
---------- ----------------------- -----------------------------------------
BlogEntry  BlogEntryComment        blog\_entries.blog\_entry\_comment\_count
========== ======================= =========================================

Once you have added the counter field you are good to go. Activate
counter-cache in your association by adding a ``counterCache`` key
and set the value to ``true``::

    class ImageComment extends AppModel {
        public $belongsTo = array(
            'Image' => array(
                'counterCache' => true,
            )
        );
    }

From now on, every time you add or remove a ``ImageComment`` associated to
``Image``, the number within ``image_comment_count`` is adjusted
automatically.

counterScope
============

You can also specify ``counterScope``. It allows you to specify a
simple condition which tells the model when to update (or when not
to, depending on how you look at it) the counter value.

Using our Image model example, we can specify it like so::

    class ImageComment extends AppModel {
        public $belongsTo = array(
            'Image' => array(
                'counterCache' => true,
                'counterScope' => array('Image.active' => 1) // only count if "Image" is active = 1
            )
        );
    }

.. _multiple-counterCache:

Multiple counterCache
=====================

Since 2.0 CakePHP supports having multiple ``counterCache`` in a single model
relation. It is also possible to define a ``counterScope`` for each ``counterCache``.
Assuming you have a ``User`` model and a ``Message`` model and you want to be able
to count the amount of read and unread messages for each user.

========= ====================== ===========================================
Model     Field                  Description
========= ====================== ===========================================
User      users.messages\_read   Count read ``Message``
--------- ---------------------- -------------------------------------------
User      users.messages\_unread Count unread ``Message``
--------- ---------------------- -------------------------------------------
Message   messages.is\_read      Determines if a ``Message`` is read or not.
========= ====================== ===========================================

With this setup your ``belongsTo`` would look like this::

    class Message extends AppModel {
        public $belongsTo = array(
            'User' => array(
                'counterCache' => array(
                    'messages_read' => array('Message.is_read' => 1),
                    'messages_unread' => array('Message.is_read' => 0)
                )
            )
        );
    }

hasAndBelongsToMany (HABTM)
---------------------------

Alright. At this point, you can already call yourself a CakePHP
model associations professional. You're already well versed in the
three associations that take up the bulk of object relations.

Let's tackle the final relationship type: hasAndBelongsToMany, or
HABTM. This association is used when you have two models that need
to be joined up, repeatedly, many times, in many different ways.

The main difference between hasMany and HABTM is that a link
between models in HABTM is not exclusive. For example, we're about
to join up our Recipe model with an Ingredient model using HABTM.
Using tomatoes as an Ingredient for my grandma's spaghetti recipe
doesn't "use up" the ingredient. I can also use it for a salad Recipe.

Links between hasMany associated objects are exclusive. If my User
hasMany Comments, a comment is only linked to a specific user. It's
no longer up for grabs.

Moving on. We'll need to set up an extra table in the database to
handle HABTM associations. This new join table's name needs to
include the names of both models involved, in alphabetical order,
and separated with an underscore ( \_ ). The contents of the table
should be two fields, each foreign keys (which should be integers)
pointing to both of the primary keys of the involved models. To
avoid any issues - don't define a combined primary key for these
two fields, if your application requires it you can define a unique
index. If you plan to add any extra information to this table, or use
a 'with' model, you should add an additional primary key field (by convention
'id').

**HABTM** requires a separate join table that includes both *model*
names.

========================= ================================================================
Relationship              HABTM Table Fields
========================= ================================================================
Recipe HABTM Ingredient   **ingredients_recipes**.id, **ingredients_recipes**.ingredient_id, **ingredients_recipes**.recipe_id
------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------
Cake HABTM Fan            **cakes_fans**.id, **cakes_fans**.cake_id, **cakes_fans**.fan_id
------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------
Foo HABTM Bar             **bars_foos**.id, **bars_foos**.foo_id, **bars_foos**.bar_id
========================= ================================================================


.. note::

    Table names are by convention in alphabetical order. It is
    possible to define a custom table name in association definition

Make sure primary keys in tables **cakes** and **recipes** have
"id" fields as assumed by convention. If they're different than
assumed, it has to be changed in model's :ref:`model-primaryKey`

Once this new table has been created, we can define the HABTM
association in the model files. We're gonna skip straight to the
array syntax this time::

    class Recipe extends AppModel {
        public $hasAndBelongsToMany = array(
            'Ingredient' =>
                array(
                    'className' => 'Ingredient',
                    'joinTable' => 'ingredients_recipes',
                    'foreignKey' => 'recipe_id',
                    'associationForeignKey' => 'ingredient_id',
                    'unique' => true,
                    'conditions' => '',
                    'fields' => '',
                    'order' => '',
                    'limit' => '',
                    'offset' => '',
                    'finderQuery' => '',
                    'with' => ''
                )
        );
    }

Possible keys for HABTM association arrays include:

.. _ref-habtm-arrays:

-  **className**: the classname of the model being associated to
   the current model. If you're defining a 'Recipe HABTM Ingredient'
   relationship, the className key should equal 'Ingredient.'
-  **joinTable**: The name of the join table used in this
   association (if the current table doesn't adhere to the naming
   convention for HABTM join tables).
-  **with**: Defines the name of the model for the join table. By
   default CakePHP will auto-create a model for you. Using the example
   above it would be called IngredientsRecipe. By using this key you can
   override this default name. The join table model can be used just
   like any "regular" model to access the join table directly. By creating
   a model class with such name and filename you can add any custom behavior
   to the join table searches, such as adding more information/columns to it
-  **foreignKey**: the name of the foreign key found in the current
   model. This is especially handy if you need to define multiple
   HABTM relationships. The default value for this key is the
   underscored, singular name of the current model, suffixed with
   '\_id'.
-  **associationForeignKey**: the name of the foreign key found in
   the other model. This is especially handy if you need to define
   multiple HABTM relationships. The default value for this key is the
   underscored, singular name of the other model, suffixed with
   '\_id'.
-  **unique**: boolean or string ``keepExisting``.
    - If true (default value) cake will first delete existing relationship
      records in the foreign keys table before inserting new ones.
      Existing associations need to be passed again when updating.
    - When false, cake will insert the relationship record, and that
      no join records are deleted during a save operation.
    - When set to ``keepExisting``, the behavior is similar to `true`,
      but existing associations are not deleted.
-  **conditions**: an array of find() compatible conditions or SQL
   string.  If you have conditions on an associated table, you should use a
   'with' model, and define the necessary belongsTo associations on it.
-  **fields**: A list of fields to be retrieved when the associated
   model data is fetched. Returns all fields by default.
-  **order**: an array of find() compatible order clauses or SQL
   strings
-  **limit**: The maximum number of associated rows you want
   returned.
-  **offset**: The number of associated rows to skip over (given
   the current conditions and order) before fetching and associating.
-  **finderQuery**: A complete SQL query CakePHP can use to fetch associated
   model records. This should be used in situations that require very custom
   results.

Once this association has been defined, find operations on the
Recipe model will also fetch related Tag records if they exist::

    // Sample results from a $this->Recipe->find() call.

    Array
    (
        [Recipe] => Array
            (
                [id] => 2745
                [name] => Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs
                [created] => 2007-05-01 10:31:01
                [user_id] => 2346
            )
        [Ingredient] => Array
            (
                [0] => Array
                    (
                        [id] => 123
                        [name] => Chocolate
                    )
               [1] => Array
                    (
                        [id] => 124
                        [name] => Sugar
                    )
               [2] => Array
                    (
                        [id] => 125
                        [name] => Bombs
                    )
            )
    )

Remember to define a HABTM association in the Ingredient model if you'd
like to fetch Recipe data when using the Ingredient model.

.. note::

   HABTM data is treated like a complete set, each time a new data association is added
   the complete set of associated rows in database is dropped and created again so you
   will always need to pass the whole data set for saving. For an alternative to using
   HABTM see :ref:`hasMany-through`

.. tip::

    For more information on saving HABTM objects see :ref:`saving-habtm`


.. _hasMany-through:

hasMany through (The Join Model)
--------------------------------

It is sometimes desirable to store additional data with a many to
many association. Consider the following

`Student hasAndBelongsToMany Course`

`Course hasAndBelongsToMany Student`

In other words, a Student can take many Courses and a Course can be
taken by many Students. This is a simple many to many association
demanding a table such as this::

    id | student_id | course_id

Now what if we want to store the number of days that were attended
by the student on the course and their final grade? The table we'd
want would be::

    id | student_id | course_id | days_attended | grade

The trouble is, hasAndBelongsToMany will not support this type of
scenario because when hasAndBelongsToMany associations are saved,
the association is deleted first. You would lose the extra data in
the columns as it is not replaced in the new insert.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.1

    You can set ``unique`` setting to ``keepExisting`` circumvent
    losing extra data during the save operation.  See ``unique``
    key in :ref:`HABTM association arrays <ref-habtm-arrays>`.

The way to implement our requirement is to use a **join model**,
otherwise known as a **hasMany through** association.
That is, the association is a model itself. So, we can create a new
model CourseMembership. Take a look at the following models.::

            // Student.php
            class Student extends AppModel {
                public $hasMany = array(
                    'CourseMembership'
                );
            }

            // Course.php

            class Course extends AppModel {
                public $hasMany = array(
                    'CourseMembership'
                );
            }

            // CourseMembership.php

            class CourseMembership extends AppModel {
                public $belongsTo = array(
                    'Student', 'Course'
                );
            }

The CourseMembership join model uniquely identifies a given
Student's participation on a Course in addition to extra
meta-information.

Join models are pretty useful things to be able to use and CakePHP
makes it easy to do so with its built-in hasMany and belongsTo
associations and saveAll feature.

.. _dynamic-associations:

Creating and Destroying Associations on the Fly
-----------------------------------------------

Sometimes it becomes necessary to create and destroy model
associations on the fly. This may be for any number of reasons:


-  You want to reduce the amount of associated data fetched, but
   all your associations are on the first level of recursion.
-  You want to change the way an association is defined in order to
   sort or filter associated data.

This association creation and destruction is done using the CakePHP
model bindModel() and unbindModel() methods. (There is also a very
helpful behavior called "Containable", please refer to manual
section about Built-in behaviors for more information). Let's set
up a few models so we can see how bindModel() and unbindModel()
work. We'll start with two models::

    class Leader extends AppModel {
        public $hasMany = array(
            'Follower' => array(
                'className' => 'Follower',
                'order' => 'Follower.rank'
            )
        );
    }

    class Follower extends AppModel {
        public $name = 'Follower';
    }

Now, in the LeadersController, we can use the find() method in the
Leader model to fetch a Leader and its associated followers. As you
can see above, the association array in the Leader model defines a
"Leader hasMany Followers" relationship. For demonstration
purposes, let's use unbindModel() to remove that association in a
controller action::

    public function some_action() {
        // This fetches Leaders, and their associated Followers
        $this->Leader->find('all');

        // Let's remove the hasMany...
        $this->Leader->unbindModel(
            array('hasMany' => array('Follower'))
        );

        // Now using a find function will return
        // Leaders, with no Followers
        $this->Leader->find('all');

        // NOTE: unbindModel only affects the very next
        // find function. An additional find call will use
        // the configured association information.

        // We've already used find('all') after unbindModel(),
        // so this will fetch Leaders with associated
        // Followers once again...
        $this->Leader->find('all');
    }

.. note::

    Removing or adding associations using bind- and unbindModel() only
    works for the *next* find operation only unless the second
    parameter has been set to false. If the second parameter has been
    set to *false*, the bind remains in place for the remainder of the
    request.

Here's the basic usage pattern for unbindModel()::

    $this->Model->unbindModel(
        array('associationType' => array('associatedModelClassName'))
    );

Now that we've successfully removed an association on the fly,
let's add one. Our as-of-yet unprincipled Leader needs some
associated Principles. The model file for our Principle model is
bare, except for the public $name statement. Let's associate some
Principles to our Leader on the fly (but remember–only for just the
following find operation). This function appears in the
LeadersController::

    public function another_action() {
        // There is no Leader hasMany Principles in
        // the leader.php model file, so a find here,
        // only fetches Leaders.
        $this->Leader->find('all');

        // Let's use bindModel() to add a new association
        // to the Leader model:
        $this->Leader->bindModel(
            array('hasMany' => array(
                    'Principle' => array(
                        'className' => 'Principle'
                    )
                )
            )
        );

        // Now that we're associated correctly,
        // we can use a single find function to fetch
        // Leaders with their associated principles:
        $this->Leader->find('all');
    }

There you have it. The basic usage for bindModel() is the
encapsulation of a normal association array inside an array whose
key is named after the type of association you are trying to
create::

    $this->Model->bindModel(
        array('associationName' => array(
                'associatedModelClassName' => array(
                    // normal association keys go here...
                )
            )
        )
    );

Even though the newly bound model doesn't need any sort of
association definition in its model file, it will still need to be
correctly keyed in order for the new association to work properly.

Multiple relations to the same model
------------------------------------

There are cases where a Model has more than one relation to another
Model. For example you might have a Message model that has two
relations to the User model. One relation to the user that sends a
message, and a second to the user that receives the message. The
messages table will have a field user\_id, but also a field
recipient\_id. Now your Message model can look something like::

    class Message extends AppModel {
        public $belongsTo = array(
            'Sender' => array(
                'className' => 'User',
                'foreignKey' => 'user_id'
            ),
            'Recipient' => array(
                'className' => 'User',
                'foreignKey' => 'recipient_id'
            )
        );
    }

Recipient is an alias for the User model. Now let's see what the
User model would look like::

    class User extends AppModel {
        public $hasMany = array(
            'MessageSent' => array(
                'className' => 'Message',
                'foreignKey' => 'user_id'
            ),
            'MessageReceived' => array(
                'className' => 'Message',
                'foreignKey' => 'recipient_id'
            )
        );
    }

It is also possible to create self associations as shown below::

    class Post extends AppModel {

        public $belongsTo = array(
            'Parent' => array(
                'className' => 'Post',
                'foreignKey' => 'parent_id'
            )
        );

        public $hasMany = array(
            'Children' => array(
                'className' => 'Post',
                'foreignKey' => 'parent_id'
            )
        );
    }

**Fetching a nested array of associated records:**

If your table has ``parent_id`` field you can also use :ref:`model-find-threaded`
to fetch nested array of records using a single query without
setting up any associations.

.. _joining-tables:

Joining tables
--------------

In SQL you can combine related tables using the JOIN statement.
This allows you to perform complex searches across multiples tables
(i.e: search posts given several tags).

In CakePHP some associations (belongsTo and hasOne) performs
automatic joins to retrieve data, so you can issue queries to
retrieve models based on data in the related one.

But this is not the case with hasMany and hasAndBelongsToMany
associations. Here is where forcing joins comes to the rescue. You
only have to define the necessary joins to combine tables and get
the desired results for your query.

.. note::

    Remember you need to set the recursion to -1 for this to work. I.e:
    $this->Channel->recursive = -1;

To force a join between tables you need to use the "modern" syntax
for Model::find(), adding a 'joins' key to the $options array. For
example::

    $options['joins'] = array(
        array('table' => 'channels',
            'alias' => 'Channel',
            'type' => 'LEFT',
            'conditions' => array(
                'Channel.id = Item.channel_id',
            )
        )
    );

    $Item->find('all', $options);

.. note::

    Note that the 'join' arrays are not keyed.

In the above example, a model called Item is left joined to the
channels table. You can alias the table with the Model name, so the
retrieved data complies with the CakePHP data structure.

The keys that define the join are the following:


-  **table**: The table for the join.
-  **alias**: An alias to the table. The name of the model
   associated with the table is the best bet.
-  **type**: The type of join: inner, left or right.
-  **conditions**: The conditions to perform the join.

With joins, you could add conditions based on Related model
fields::

    $options['joins'] = array(
        array('table' => 'channels',
            'alias' => 'Channel',
            'type' => 'LEFT',
            'conditions' => array(
                'Channel.id = Item.channel_id',
            )
        )
    );

    $options['conditions'] = array(
        'Channel.private' => 1
    );

    $privateItems = $Item->find('all', $options);

You could perform several joins as needed in hasAndBelongsToMany:

Suppose a Book hasAndBelongsToMany Tag association. This relation
uses a books\_tags table as join table, so you need to join the
books table to the books\_tags table, and this with the tags
table::

    $options['joins'] = array(
        array('table' => 'books_tags',
            'alias' => 'BooksTag',
            'type' => 'inner',
            'conditions' => array(
                'Books.id = BooksTag.book_id'
            )
        ),
        array('table' => 'tags',
            'alias' => 'Tag',
            'type' => 'inner',
            'conditions' => array(
                'BooksTag.tag_id = Tag.id'
            )
        )
    );

    $options['conditions'] = array(
        'Tag.tag' => 'Novel'
    );

    $books = $Book->find('all', $options);

Using joins allows you to have a maximum flexibility in how CakePHP handles associations
and fetch the data, however in most cases you can use other tools to achieve the same results
such as correctly defining associations, binding models on the fly and using the Containable
behavior. This feature should be used with care because it could lead, in a few cases, into bad formed
SQL queries if combined with any of the former techniques described for associating models.
