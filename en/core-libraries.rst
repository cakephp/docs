Core Libraries
##############

CakePHP comes with a plethora of built-in functions and classes. These classes
and functions try to cover some of the most common features required in web
applications.

General Purpose

General purpose libraries are available and reused in many places across
CakePHP.

Helpers

CakePHP features a number of helpers that aid in view creation. They assist in
creating well-formed markup (including forms), aid in formatting text, times and
numbers, and can even integrate with popular javascript libraries. Here is a
summary of the built-in helpers. 

Read :doc:`/views/helpers` to learn more about helpers, their api, and how you
can create and use your own helpers.
