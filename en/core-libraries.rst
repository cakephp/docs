Core Libraries
##############

CakePHP comes with a plethora of built-in functions and classes. These classes
and functions try to cover some of the most common features required in web
applications.

General Purpose
===============

General purpose libraries are available and reused in many places across
CakePHP.

Helpers

CakePHP features a number of helpers that aid in view creation. They assist in
creating well-formed markup (including forms), aid in formatting text, times and
numbers, and can even integrate with popular javascript libraries. Here is a
summary of the built-in helpers.

Read :doc:`/views/helpers` to learn more about helpers, their api, and how you
can create and use your own helpers.
