CakePHP comes with a plethora of built-in functions and classes.  These classes
and functions try to cover some of the most common features required in web
applications.

numbers, and can even integrate with popular javascript libraries. Here is a
summary of the built-in helpers. 

Read :doc:`/views/helpers` to learn more about helpers, their api, and how you
can create and use your own helpers.
