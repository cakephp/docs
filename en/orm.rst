Database Access & ORM
#####################

In CakePHP working with data through the database is done with two primary object
types. The first are **repositories** or **table objects**. These objects
provide access to collections of data. They allow you to save new records,
modify/delete existing ones, define relations, and perform bulk operations. The
second type of objects are **entities**. Entities represent individual records
and allow you to define row/record level behavior & functionality.

These two classes are usually responsible for managing almost everything
that happens regarding your data, its validity, interactions and evolution
of the information workflow in your domain of work.

CakePHP's built-in ORM specializes in relational databases, but can be extended
to support alternative datasources.

The CakePHP ORM borrows ideas and concepts from both ActiveRecord and Datamapper
patterns. It aims to create a hybrid implementation that combines aspects of
both patterns to create a fast, simple to use ORM.

Before we get started exploring the ORM, make sure you :ref:`configure your
database connections <database-configuration>`.

Quick Example
=============

To get started you don't have to write any code. If you've followed the :ref:`CakePHP
conventions for your database tables <model-and-database-conventions>`
you can just start using the ORM. For example if we wanted to load some data from our ``articles``
table we could do::

    use Cake\ORM\TableRegistry;

    // Prior to 3.6.0
    $articles = TableRegistry::get('Articles');

    $articles = TableRegistry::getTableLocator()->get('Articles');

    $query = $articles->find();

    foreach ($query as $row) {
        echo $row->title;
    }

Note that we didn't have to create any code or wire any configuration up.
The conventions in CakePHP allow us to skip some boilerplate code and allow the
framework to insert base classes when your application has not created
a concrete class. If we wanted to customize our ArticlesTable class adding some
associations or defining some additional methods we would add the following to
**src/Model/Table/ArticlesTable.php** after the ``<?php`` opening tag::

    namespace App\Model\Table;

    use Cake\ORM\Table;

    class ArticlesTable extends Table
    {
    }

Table classes use the CamelCased version of the table name with the ``Table``
suffix as the class name. Once your class has been created you get a reference
to it using the :php:class:`~Cake\\ORM\\Locator\\TableLocator` through :php:class:`~Cake\\ORM\\TableRegistry` as before::

    use Cake\ORM\TableRegistry;

    // Now $articles is an instance of our ArticlesTable class.
    $articles = TableRegistry::getTableLocator()->get('Articles');

    // Prior to 3.6.0
    $articles = TableRegistry::get('Articles');

Now that we have a concrete table class, we'll probably want to use a concrete
entity class. Entity classes let you define accessor and mutator methods, define
custom logic for individual records and much more. We'll start off by adding the
following to **src/Model/Entity/Article.php** after the ``<?php`` opening tag::

    namespace App\Model\Entity;

    use Cake\ORM\Entity;

    class Article extends Entity
    {
    }

Entities use the singular CamelCase version of the table name as their class
name by default. Now that we have created our entity class, when we
load entities from the database we'll get instances of our new Article class::

    use Cake\ORM\TableRegistry;

    // Prior to 3.6.0
    $articles = TableRegistry::get('Articles');

    // Now an instance of ArticlesTable.
    $articles = TableRegistry::getTableLocator()->get('Articles');
    $query = $articles->find();

    foreach ($query as $row) {
        // Each row is now an instance of our Article class.
        echo $row->title;
    }

CakePHP uses naming conventions to link the Table and Entity class together. If
you need to customize which entity a table uses you can use the
``entityClass()`` method to set a specific classname.

See the chapters on :doc:`/orm/table-objects` and :doc:`/orm/entities` for more
information on how to use table objects and entities in your application.
