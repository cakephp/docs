A Typical CakePHP Request
#########################

We've covered the basic ingredients in CakePHP, so let's look at
how objects work together to complete a basic request. Continuing
with our original request example, let's imagine that our friend
Ricardo just clicked on the "Buy A Custom Cake Now!" link on a
CakePHP application's landing page.

#. Ricardo clicks the link pointing to
   http://www.example.com/cakes/buy, and his browser makes a request
   to your web server.
#. The Router parses the URL in order to extract the parameters for
   this request: the controller, action, and any other arguments that
   will affect the business logic during this request.
#. Using routes, a request URL is mapped to a controller action (a
   method in a specific controller class). In this case, it's the
   buy() method of the CakesController. The controller's
   beforeFilter() callback is called before any controller action
   logic is executed.
#. The controller may use models to gain access to the
   application's data. In this example, the controller uses a model to
   fetch Ricardo's last purchases from the database. Any applicable
   model callbacks, behaviors, and DataSources may apply during this
   operation. While model usage is not required, all CakePHP
   controllers initially require at least one model.
#. After the model has retrieved the data, it is returned to the
   controller. Model callbacks may apply.
#. The controller may use components to further refine the data or
   perform other operations (session manipulation, authentication, or
   sending emails, for example).
#. Once the controller has used models and components to prepare
   the data sufficiently, that data is handed to the view using the
   controller's set() method. Controller callbacks may be applied
   before the data is sent. The view logic is performed, which may
   include the use of elements and/or helpers. By default, the view is
   rendered inside of a layout.
#. Additional controller callbacks (like afterFilter) may be
   applied. The complete, rendered view code is sent to Ricardo's
   browser.
