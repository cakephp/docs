CakePHP Folder Structure
########################

After you've downloaded and extracted the CakePHP application, these are the files
and folders you should see:

- App
- Plugin
- tmp
- vendor
- webroot
- .htaccess
- composer.json
- index.php
- README.md

You'll notice three main folders:

- The *App* folder will be where you work your magic: it’s where
  your application’s files will be placed.
- The *Plugin* folder is where the :doc:`/plugins` your application uses are stored.
- The *vendor* folder is where CakePHP and other application dependencies will
  be installed. Make a personal commitment **not** to edit files in this folder.
  We can’t help you if you’ve modified the core.
- The *webroot* directory is public document root of your application. It
  contains all the files you want to be publically reachable.
- The *tmp* folder is where CakePHP stores temporary data. The actual data it
  stores depends on how you have CakePHP configured, but this folder
  is usually used to store model descriptions, logs, and sometimes
  session information.

  Make sure that this folder exists and that it is writable,
  otherwise the performance of your application will be severely
  impacted. In debug mode, CakePHP will warn you if it is not the
  case.

The App Folder
==============

CakePHP’s app folder is where you will do most of your application
development. Let’s look a little closer at the folders inside of
app.

Config
    Holds the (few) configuration files CakePHP uses. Database
    connection details, bootstrapping, core configuration files and
    more should be stored here.
Console
    Contains the console commands and console tasks for your application.
    This directory can also contain a ``Templates`` directory to customize the
    output of bake. For more information see :doc:`/console-and-shells`.
Controller
    Contains your application’s controllers and their components.
Lib
    Contains 1st party libraries that do not come from 3rd parties or
    external vendors. This allows you to separate your organization's
    internal libraries from vendor libraries.
Locale
    Stores string files for internationalization.
Model
    Contains your application’s models, behaviors, and datasources.
Test
    This directory contains all the test cases, and test fixtures for your
    application. The ``Test/Case`` directory should mirror your application and
    contain one or more test cases per class in your application. For more
    information on test cases and test fixtures refer to the :doc:`/development/testing`
    documentation.
View
    Presentational files are placed here: elements, error pages,
    helpers, layouts, and view files.
webroot
    In a production setup, this folder should serve as the document
    root for your application. Folders here also serve as holding
    places for CSS stylesheets, images, and JavaScript files.
