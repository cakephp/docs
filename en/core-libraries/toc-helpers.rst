Helpers
#######

CakePHP features a number of helpers that aid in view creation. They assist in
creating well-formed markup (including forms), aid in formatting text, times and
numbers, and can even integrate with popular javascript libraries. Here is a
summary of the built-in helpers. 

Read :doc:`/views/helpers` to learn more about helpers, their api, and how you
can create and use your own helpers.
