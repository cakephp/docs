Collections
###########

.. php:namespace:: Cake\Collection

.. php:class:: Collection

The collection classes provide a set of tools to manipulate arrays or
``Traversable`` objects. If you have ever used underscore.js,
you have an idea of what you can expect from the collection classes.

Collection instances are immutable; modifying a collection will instead generate
a new collection. This makes working with collection objects more predictable as
operations are side-effect free.

Quick Example
=============

Collections can be created using an array or ``Traversable`` object. You'll also
interact with collections every time you interact with the ORM in CakePHP.
A simple use of a Collection would be::

    use Cake\Collection\Collection;

    $items = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3];
    $collection = new Collection($items);

    // Create a new collection containing elements
    // with a value greater than one.
    $overOne = $collection->filter(function ($value, $key, $iterator) {
        return $value > 1;
    });

You can also use the ``collection()`` helper function instead of ``new
Collection()``::

    $items = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3];

    // These both make a Collection instance.
    $collectionA = new Collection($items);
    $collectionB = collection($items);

The benefit of the helper method is that it is easier to chain off of than
``(new Collection($items))``.

The :php:trait:`~Cake\\Collection\\CollectionTrait` allows you to integrate
collection-like features into any ``Traversable`` object you have in your
application as well.

    +-----------------------+------------------------+----------------------+---------------------+

Iterating
=========

.. php:method:: each(callable $c)

Collections can be iterated and/or transformed into new collections with the
``each()`` and ``map()`` methods. The ``each()`` method will not create a new
collection, but will allow you to modify any objects within the collection::

    $collection = new Collection($items);
    $collection = $collection->each(function ($value, $key) {
        echo "Element $key: $value";
    });


The return of ``each()`` will be the collection object. Each will iterate the
collection immediately applying the callback to each value in the collection.

.. php:method:: map(callable $c)

The ``map()`` method will create a new collection based on the output of the
callback being applied to each object in the original collection::

    $items = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3];
    $collection = new Collection($items);

    $new = $collection->map(function ($value, $key) {
        return $value * 2;
    });

    // $result contains ['a' => 2, 'b' => 4, 'c' => 6];
    $result = $new->toArray();

The ``map()`` method will create a new iterator which lazily creates
the resulting items when iterated.

.. php:method:: extract($matcher)

One of the most common uses for a ``map()`` function is to extract a single
column from a collection. If you are looking to build a list of elements
containing the values for a particular property, you can use the ``extract()``
method::

    $collection = new Collection($people);
    $names = $collection->extract('name');

    // $result contains ['mark', 'jose', 'barbara'];
    $result = $names->toArray();

As with many other functions in the collection class, you are allowed to specify
a dot-separated path for extracting columns. This example will return
a collection containing the author names from a list of articles::

    $collection = new Collection($articles);
    $names = $collection->extract('author.name');

    // $result contains ['Maria', 'Stacy', 'Larry'];
    $result = $names->toArray();

Finally, if the property you are looking after cannot be expressed as a path,
you can use a callback function to return it::

    $collection = new Collection($articles);
    $names = $collection->extract(function ($article) {
        return $article->author->name . ', ' . $article->author->last_name;
    });

Often, the properties you need to extract a common key present in multiple
arrays or objects that are deeply nested inside other structures. For those
cases you can use the ``{*}`` matcher in the path key. This matcher is often
helpful when matching HasMany and BelongsToMany association data::

    $data = [
        [
            'name' => 'James',
            'phone_numbers' => [
                ['number' => 'number-1'],
                ['number' => 'number-2'],
                ['number' => 'number-3'],
            ]
        ],
        [
            'name' => 'James',
            'phone_numbers' => [
                ['number' => 'number-4'],
                ['number' => 'number-5'],
            ]
        ]
    ];

    $numbers = (new Collection($data))->extract('phone_numbers.{*}.number');
    $numbers->toList();
    // Returns ['number-1', 'number-2', 'number-3', 'number-4', 'number-5']

This last example uses ``toList()`` unlike other examples, which is important
when we're getting results with possibly duplicate keys. By using ``toList()``
we'll be guaranteed to get all values even if there are duplicate keys.

Unlike :php:meth:`Cake\\Utility\\Hash::extract()` this method only supports the
``{*}`` wildcard. All other wildcard and attributes matchers are not supported.

.. php:method:: combine($keyPath, $valuePath, $groupPath = null)

Collections allow you to create a new collection made from keys and values in
an existing collection. Both the key and value paths can be specified with
dot notation paths::

    $items = [
        ['id' => 1, 'name' => 'foo', 'parent' => 'a'],
        ['id' => 2, 'name' => 'bar', 'parent' => 'b'],
        ['id' => 3, 'name' => 'baz', 'parent' => 'a'],
    ];
    $combined = (new Collection($items))->combine('id', 'name');

    // Result will look like this when converted to array
    [
        1 => 'foo',
        2 => 'bar',
        3 => 'baz',
    ];

You can also optionally use a ``groupPath`` to group results based on a path::

    $combined = (new Collection($items))->combine('id', 'name', 'parent');

    // Result will look like this when converted to array
    [
        'a' => [1 => 'foo', 3 => 'baz'],
        'b' => [2 => 'bar']
    ];

Finally you can use *closures* to build keys/values/groups paths dynamically,
for example when working with entities and dates (converted to ``Cake/Time``
instances by the ORM) you may want to group results by date::

    $combined = (new Collection($entities))->combine(
        'id',
        function ($entity) { return $entity; },
        function ($entity) { return $entity->date->toDateString(); }
    );

    // Result will look like this when converted to array
    [
        'date string like 2015-05-01' => ['entity1->id' => entity1, 'entity2->id' => entity2, ..., 'entityN->id' => entityN]
        'date string like 2015-06-01' => ['entity1->id' => entity1, 'entity2->id' => entity2, ..., 'entityN->id' => entityN]
    ]

.. php:method:: stopWhen(callable $c)

You can stop the iteration at any point using the ``stopWhen()`` method. Calling
it in a collection will create a new one that will stop yielding results if the
passed callable returns false for one of the elements::

    $items = [10, 20, 50, 1, 2];
    $collection = new Collection($items);

    $new = $collection->stopWhen(function ($value, $key) {
        // Stop on the first value bigger than 30
        return $value > 30;
    });

    // $result contains [10, 20];
    $result = $new->toArray();

.. php:method:: unfold(callable $c)

Sometimes the internal items of a collection will contain arrays or iterators
with more items. If you wish to flatten the internal structure to iterate once
over all elements you can use the ``unfold()`` method. It will create a new
collection that will yield every single element nested in the collection::

    $items = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]];
    $collection = new Collection($items);
    $new = $collection->unfold();

    // $result contains [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    $result = $new->toList();

When passing a callable to ``unfold()`` you can control what elements will be
unfolded from each item in the original collection. This is useful for returning
data from paginated services::

    $pages = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    $collection = new Collection($pages);
    $items = $collection->unfold(function ($page, $key) {
        // An imaginary web service that returns a page of results
        return MyService::fetchPage($page)->toArray();
    });

    $allPagesItems = $items->toList();

If you are using PHP 5.5+, you can use the ``yield`` keyword inside ``unfold()``
to return as many elements for each item in the collection as you may need::

    $oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7];
    $collection = new Collection($oddNumbers);
    $new = $collection->unfold(function ($oddNumber) {
        yield $oddNumber;
        yield $oddNumber + 1;
    });

    // $result contains [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
    $result = $new->toList();


.. php:method:: chunk($chunkSize)

When dealing with big amounts of items in a collection, it may make sense to
process the elements in batches instead of one by one. For splitting
a collection into multiple arrays of a certain size, you can use the ``chunk()``
function::

    $items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11];
    $collection = new Collection($items);
    $chunked = $collection->chunk(2);
    $chunked->toList(); // [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10], [11]]

The ``chunk`` function is particularly useful when doing batch processing, for
example with a database result::

    $collection = new Collection($articles);
    $collection->map(function ($article) {
            // Change a property in the article
            $article->property = 'changed';
        })
        ->chunk(20)
        ->each(function ($batch) {
            myBulkSave($batch); // This function will be called for each batch
        });

Filtering
=========

.. php:method:: filter(callable $c)

Collections make it easy to filter and create new collections based on
the result of callback functions. You can use ``filter()`` to create a new
collection of elements matching a criteria callback::

    $collection = new Collection($people);
    $ladies = $collection->filter(function ($person, $key) {
        return $person->gender === 'female';
    });
    $guys = $collection->filter(function ($person, $key) {
        return $person->gender === 'male';
    });

.. php:method:: reject(callable $c)

The inverse of ``filter()`` is ``reject()``. This method does a negative filter,
removing elements that match the filter function::

    $collection = new Collection($people);
    $ladies = $collection->reject(function ($person, $key) {
        return $person->gender === 'male';
    });

.. php:method:: every(callable $c)

You can do truth tests with filter functions. To see if every element in
a collection matches a test you can use ``every()``::

    $collection = new Collection($people);
    $allYoungPeople = $collection->every(function ($person) {
        return $person->age < 21;
    });

.. php:method:: some(callable $c)

You can see if the collection contains at least one element matching a filter
function using the ``some()`` method::

    $collection = new Collection($people);
    $hasYoungPeople = $collection->some(function ($person) {
        return $person->age < 21;
    });

.. php:method:: match(array $conditions)

If you need to extract a new collection containing only the elements that
contain a given set of properties, you should use the ``match()`` method::

    $collection = new Collection($comments);
    $commentsFromMark = $collection->match(['user.name' => 'Mark']);

.. php:method:: firstMatch(array $conditions)

The property name can be a dot-separated path. You can traverse into nested
entities and match the values they contain. When you only need the first
matching element from a collection, you can use ``firstMatch()``::

    $collection = new Collection($comments);
    $comment = $collection->firstMatch([
        'user.name' => 'Mark',
        'active' => true
    ]);

As you can see from the above, both ``match()`` and ``firstMatch()`` allow you
to provide multiple conditions to match on. In addition, the conditions can be
for different paths, allowing you to express complex conditions to match
against.

Aggregation
===========

.. php:method:: reduce(callable $c)

The counterpart of a ``map()`` operation is usually a ``reduce``. This
function will help you build a single result out of all the elements in a
collection::

    $totalPrice = $collection->reduce(function ($accumulated, $orderLine) {
        return $accumulated + $orderLine->price;
    }, 0);

In the above example, ``$totalPrice`` will be the sum of all single prices
contained in the collection. Note the second argument for the ``reduce()``
function takes the initial value for the reduce operation you are
performing::

    $allTags = $collection->reduce(function ($accumulated, $article) {
        return array_merge($accumulated, $article->tags);
    }, []);

.. php:method:: min(string|callable $callback, $type = SORT_NUMERIC)

To extract the minimum value for a collection based on a property, just use the
``min()`` function. This will return the full element from the collection and
not just the smallest value found::

    $collection = new Collection($people);
    $youngest = $collection->min('age');

    echo $youngest->name;

You are also able to express the property to compare by providing a path or a
callback function::

    $collection = new Collection($people);
    $personYoungestChild = $collection->min(function ($person) {
        return $person->child->age;
    });

    $personWithYoungestDad = $collection->min('dad.age');

.. php:method:: max(string|callable $callback, $type = SORT_NUMERIC)

The same can be applied to the ``max()`` function, which will return a single
element from the collection having the highest property value::

    $collection = new Collection($people);
    $oldest = $collection->max('age');

    $personOldestChild = $collection->max(function ($person) {
        return $person->child->age;
    });

    $personWithOldestDad = $collection->min('dad.age');

.. php:method:: sumOf(string|callable $callback)

Finally, the ``sumOf()`` method will return the sum of a property of all
elements::

    $collection = new Collection($people);
    $sumOfAges =  $collection->sumOf('age');

    $sumOfChildrenAges = $collection->sumOf(function ($person) {
        return $person->child->age;
    });

    $sumOfDadAges = $collection->sumOf('dad.age');

Grouping and Counting
---------------------

.. php:method:: groupBy($callback)

Collection values can be grouped by different keys in a new collection when they
share the same value for a property::

    $students = [
        ['name' => 'Mark', 'grade' => 9],
        ['name' => 'Andrew', 'grade' => 10],
        ['name' => 'Stacy', 'grade' => 10],
        ['name' => 'Barbara', 'grade' => 9]
    ];
    $collection = new Collection($students);
    $studentsByGrade = $collection->groupBy('grade');

    // Result will look like this when converted to array:
    [
      10 => [
        ['name' => 'Andrew', 'grade' => 10],
        ['name' => 'Stacy', 'grade' => 10]
      ],
      9 => [
        ['name' => 'Mark', 'grade' => 9],
        ['name' => 'Barbara', 'grade' => 9]
      ]
    ]

As usual, it is possible to provide either a dot-separated path for nested
properties or your own callback function to generate the groups dynamically::

    $commentsByUserId = $comments->groupBy('user.id');

    $classResults = $students->groupBy(function ($student) {
        return $student->grade > 6 ? 'approved' : 'denied';
    });

.. php:method:: countBy($callback)

If you only wish to know the number of occurrences per group, you can do so by
using the ``countBy()`` method. It takes the same arguments as ``groupBy`` so it
should be already familiar to you::

    $classResults = $students->countBy(function ($student) {
        return $student->grade > 6 ? 'approved' : 'denied';
    });

    // Result could look like this when converted to array:
    ['approved' => 70, 'denied' => 20]

.. php:method:: indexBy($callback)

There will be certain cases where you know an element is unique for the property
you want to group by. If you wish a single result per group, you can use the
function ``indexBy()``::

    $usersById = $users->indexBy('id');

    // When converted to array result could look like
    [
        1 => 'markstory',
        3 => 'jose_zap',
        4 => 'jrbasso'
    ]

As with the ``groupBy()`` function you can also use a property path or
a callback::

    $articlesByAuthorId = $articles->indexBy('author.id');

    $filesByHash = $files->indexBy(function ($file) {
        return md5($file);
    });

.. php:method:: zip($elements)

The elements of different collections can be grouped together using the
``zip()`` method. It will return a new collection containing an array grouping
the elements from each collection that are placed at the same position::

    $odds = new Collection([1, 3, 5]);
    $pairs = new Collection([2, 4, 6]);
    $combined = $odds->zip($pairs)->toList(); // [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

You can also zip multiple collections at once::

    $years = new Collection([2013, 2014, 2015, 2016]);
    $salaries = [1000, 1500, 2000, 2300];
    $increments = [0, 500, 500, 300];

    $rows = $years->zip($salaries, $increments)->toList();
    // Returns:
    [
        [2013, 1000, 0],
        [2014, 1500, 500],
        [2015, 2000, 500],
        [2016, 2300, 300]
    ]

As you can already see, the ``zip()`` method is very useful for transposing
multidimensional arrays::

    $data = [
        2014 => ['jan' => 100, 'feb' => 200],
        2015 => ['jan' => 300, 'feb' => 500],
        2016 => ['jan' => 400, 'feb' => 600],
    ]

    // Getting jan and feb data together

    $firstYear = new Collection(array_shift($data));
    $firstYear->zip($data[0], $data[1])->toList();

    // Or $firstYear->zip(...$data) in PHP >= 5.6

    // Returns
    [
        [100, 300, 400],
        [200, 500, 600]
    ]

Sorting
=======

.. php:method:: sortBy($callback)

Collection values can be sorted in ascending or descending order based on
a column or custom function. To create a new sorted collection out of the values
of another one, you can use ``sortBy``::

    $collection = new Collection($people);
    $sorted = $collection->sortBy('age');

As seen above, you can sort by passing the name of a column or property that
is present in the collection values. You are also able to specify a property
path instead using the dot notation. The next example will sort articles by
their author's name::

    $collection = new Collection($articles);
    $sorted = $collection->sortBy('author.name');

The ``sortBy()`` method is flexible enough to let you specify an extractor
function that will let you dynamically select the value to use for comparing two
different values in the collection::

    $collection = new Collection($articles);
    $sorted = $collection->sortBy(function ($article) {
        return $article->author->name . '-' . $article->title;
    });

In order to specify in which direction the collection should be sorted, you need
to provide either ``SORT_ASC`` or ``SORT_DESC`` as the second parameter for
sorting in ascending or descending direction respectively. By default,
collections are sorted in ascending direction::

    $collection = new Collection($people);
    $sorted = $collection->sortBy('age', SORT_ASC);

Sometimes you will need to specify which type of data you are trying to compare
so that you get consistent results. For this purpose, you should supply a third
argument in the ``sortBy()`` function with one of the following constants:

- **SORT_NUMERIC**: For comparing numbers
- **SORT_STRING**: For comparing string values
- **SORT_NATURAL**: For sorting string containing numbers and you'd like those
  numbers to be order in a natural way. For example: showing "10" after "2".
- **SORT_LOCALE_STRING**: For comparing strings based on the current locale.

By default, ``SORT_NUMERIC`` is used::

    $collection = new Collection($articles);
    $sorted = $collection->sortBy('title', SORT_ASC, SORT_NATURAL);

.. warning::

    If is often expensive to iterate sorted collections more than once. If you
    plan to do so, consider converting the collection to an array or simply use
    the ``compile()`` method on it.

Working with Tree Data
======================

.. php:method:: nest($idPath, $parentPath)

Not all data is meant to be represented in a linear way. Collections make it
easier to construct and flatten hierarchical or nested structures. Creating
a nested structure where children are grouped by a parent identifier property is
easy with the ``nest()`` method.

Two parameters are required for this function. The first one is the property
representing the item identifier. The second parameter is the name of the
property representing the identifier for the parent item::

    $collection = new Collection([
        ['id' => 1, 'parent_id' => null, 'name' => 'Birds'],
        ['id' => 2, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Land Birds'],
        ['id' => 3, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Eagle'],
        ['id' => 4, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Seagull'],
        ['id' => 5, 'parent_id' => 6, 'name' => 'Clown Fish'],
        ['id' => 6, 'parent_id' => null, 'name' => 'Fish'],
    ]);

    $collection->nest('id', 'parent_id')->toArray();
    // Returns
    [
        [
            'id' => 1,
            'parent_id' => null,
            'name' => 'Birds',
            'children' => [
                ['id' => 2, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Land Birds', 'children' => []],
                ['id' => 3, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Eagle', 'children' => []],
                ['id' => 4, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Seagull', 'children' => []],
            ]
        ],
        [
            'id' => 6,
            'parent_id' => null,
            'name' => 'Fish',
            'children' => [
                ['id' => 5, 'parent_id' => 6, 'name' => 'Clown Fish', 'children' => []],
            ]
        ]
    ];

Children elements are nested inside the ``children`` property inside each of the
items in the collection. This type of data representation is helpful for
rendering menus or traversing elements up to certain level in the tree.

.. php:method:: listNested($dir = 'desc', $nestingKey = 'children')

The inverse of ``nest()`` is ``listNested()``. This method allows you to flatten
a tree structure back into a linear structure. It takes two parameters; the
first one is the traversing mode (asc, desc or leaves), and the second one is
the name of the property containing the children for each element in the
collection.

Taking the input the nested collection built in the previous example, we can
flatten it::

    $nested->listNested()->toList();

    // Returns
    [
        ['id' => 1, 'parent_id' => null, 'name' => 'Birds', 'children' => [...]],
        ['id' => 2, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Land Birds'],
        ['id' => 3, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Eagle'],
        ['id' => 4, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Seagull'],
        ['id' => 6, 'parent_id' => null, 'name' => 'Fish', 'children' => [...]],
        ['id' => 5, 'parent_id' => 6, 'name' => 'Clown Fish']
    ]

By default, the tree is traversed from the root to the leaves. You can also
instruct it to only return the leaf elements in the tree::

    $nested->listNested()->toArray();

    // Returns
    [
        ['id' => 3, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Eagle'],
        ['id' => 4, 'parent_id' => 1, 'name' => 'Seagull'],
        ['id' => 5, 'parent_id' => 6, 'name' => 'Clown Fish']
    ]

Once you have converted a tree into a nested list, you can use the ``printer()``
method to configure how the list output should be formatted::

    $nested->listNested()->printer('name', 'id', '--')->toArray();

    // Returns
    [
        3 => 'Eagle',
        4 => 'Seagull',
        5 -> '--Clown Fish',
    ]

The ``printer()`` method also lets you use a callback to generate the keys and
or values::

    $nested->listNested()->printer(
        function ($el) {
            return $el->name;
        },
        function ($el) {
            return $el->id;
        }
    );

Other Methods
=============

.. php:method:: isEmpty()

Allows you to see if a collection contains any elements::

    $collection = new Collection([]);
    // Returns true
    $collection->isEmpty();

    $collection = new Collection([1]);
    // Returns false
    $collection->isEmpty();

.. php:method:: contains($value)

Collections allow you to quickly check if they contain one particular
value: by using the ``contains()`` method::

    $items = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3];
    $collection = new Collection($items);
    $hasThree = $collection->contains(3);

Comparisons are performed using the ``===`` operator. If you wish to do looser
comparison types you can use the ``some()`` method.

.. php:method:: shuffle()

Sometimes you may wish to show a collection of values in a random order. In
order to create a new collection that will return each value in a randomized
position, use the ``shuffle``::

    $collection = new Collection(['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3]);

    // This could return [2, 3, 1]
    $collection->shuffle()->toArray();

.. php:method:: transpose()

When you transpose a collection, you get a new collection containing a row made
of the each of the original columns::

     $items = [
        ['Products', '2012', '2013', '2014'],
        ['Product A', '200', '100', '50'],
        ['Product B', '300', '200', '100'],
        ['Product C', '400', '300', '200'],
     ]
     $transpose = (new Collection($items))->transpose()->toList();

     // Returns
     [
         ['Products', 'Product A', 'Product B', 'Product C'],
         ['2012', '200', '300', '400'],
         ['2013', '100', '200', '300'],
         ['2014', '50', '100', '200'],
     ]

.. versionadded:: 3.3.0
    ``Collection::transpose()`` was added in 3.3.0.

Withdrawing Elements
--------------------

.. php:method:: sample(int $size)

Shuffling a collection is often useful when doing quick statistical analysis.
Another common operation when doing this sort of task is withdrawing a few
random values out of a collection so that more tests can be performed on those.
For example, if you wanted to select 5 random users to which you'd like to apply
some A/B tests to, you can use the ``sample()`` function::

    $collection = new Collection($people);

    // Withdraw maximum 20 random users from this collection
    $testSubjects = $collection->sample(20);

``sample()`` will take at most the number of values you specify in the first
argument. If there are not enough elements in the collection to satisfy the
sample, the full collection in a random order is returned.

.. php:method:: take(int $size, int $from)

Whenever you want to take a slice of a collection use the ``take()`` function,
it will create a new collection with at most the number of values you specify in
the first argument, starting from the position passed in the second argument::

    $topFive = $collection->sortBy('age')->take(5);

    // Take 5 people from the collection starting from position 4
    $nextTopFive = $collection->sortBy('age')->take(5, 4);

Positions are zero-based, therefore the first position number is ``0``.

.. php:method:: skip(int $positions)

While the second argument of ``take()`` can help you skip some elements before
getting them from the collection, you can also use ``skip()`` for the same
purpose as a way to take the rest of the elements after a certain position::

    $collection = new Collection([1, 2, 3, 4]);
    $allExceptFirstTwo = $collection->skip(2)->toList(); // [3, 4]

.. php:method:: first()

One of the most common uses of ``take()`` is getting the first element in the
collection. A shortcut method for achieving the same goal is using the
``first()`` method::

    $collection = new Collection([5, 4, 3, 2]);
    $collection->first(); // Returns 5

.. php:method:: last()

Similarly, you can get the last element of a collection using the ``last()``
method::

    $collection = new Collection([5, 4, 3, 2]);
    $collection->last(); // Returns 2

Expanding Collections
---------------------

.. php:method:: append(array|Traversable $items)

You can compose multiple collections into a single one. This enables you to
gather data from various sources, concatenate it, and apply other collection
functions to it very smoothly. The ``append()`` method will return a new
collection containing the values from both sources::

    $cakephpTweets = new Collection($tweets);
    $myTimeline = $cakephpTweets->append($phpTweets);

    // Tweets containing cakefest from both sources
    $myTimeline->filter(function ($tweet) {
        return strpos($tweet, 'cakefest');
    });

.. warning::

    When appending from different sources, you can expect some keys from both
    collections to be the same. For example, when appending two simple arrays.
    This can present a problem when converting a collection to an array using
    ``toArray()``. If you do not want values from one collection to override
    others in the previous one based on their key, make sure that you call
    ``toList()`` in order to drop the keys and preserve all values.

Modifiying Elements
-------------------

.. php:method:: insert(string $path, array|Traversable $items)

At times, you may have two separate sets of data that you would like to insert
the elements of one set into each of the elements of the other set. This is
a very common case when you fetch data from a data source that does not support
data-merging or joins natively.

Collections offer an ``insert()`` method that will allow you to insert each of
the elements in one collection into a property inside each of the elements of
another collection::

    $users = [
        ['username' => 'mark'],
        ['username' => 'juan'],
        ['username' => 'jose']
    ];

    $languages = [
        ['PHP', 'Python', 'Ruby'],
        ['Bash', 'PHP', 'Javascript'],
        ['Javascript', 'Prolog']
    ];

    $merged = (new Collection($users))->insert('skills', $languages);

When converted to an array, the ``$merged`` collection will look like this::

    [
        ['username' => 'mark', 'skills' => ['PHP', 'Python', 'Ruby']],
        ['username' => 'juan', 'skills' => ['Bash', 'PHP', 'Javascript']],
        ['username' => 'jose', 'skills' => ['Javascript', 'Prolog']]
    ];

The first parameter for the ``insert()`` method is a dot-separated path of
properties to follow so that the elements can be inserted at that position. The
second argument is anything that can be converted to a collection object.

Please observe that elements are inserted by the position they are found, thus,
the first element of the second collection is merged into the first
element of the first collection.

If there are not enough elements in the second collection to insert into the
first one, then the target property will be filled with ``null`` values::

    $languages = [
        ['PHP', 'Python', 'Ruby'],
        ['Bash', 'PHP', 'Javascript']
    ];

    $merged = (new Collection($users))->insert('skills', $languages);

    // Will yield
    [
        ['username' => 'mark', 'skills' => ['PHP', 'Python', 'Ruby']],
        ['username' => 'juan', 'skills' => ['Bash', 'PHP', 'Javascript']],
        ['username' => 'jose', 'skills' => null]
    ];

The ``insert()`` method can operate array elements or objects implementing the
``ArrayAccess`` interface.

Making Collection Methods Reusable
----------------------------------

Using closures for collection methods is great when the work to be done is small
and focused, but it can get messy very quickly. This becomes more obvious when
a lot of different methods need to be called or when the length of the closure
methods is more than just a few lines.

There are also cases when the logic used for the collection methods can be
reused in multiple parts of your application. It is recommended that you
consider extracting complex collection logic to separate classes. For example,
imagine a lengthy closure like this one::

        $collection
                ->map(function ($row, $key) {
                    if (!empty($row['items'])) {
                        $row['total'] = collection($row['items'])->sumOf('price');
                    }

                    if (!empty($row['total'])) {
                        $row['tax_amount'] = $row['total'] * 0.25;
                    }

                    // More code here...

                    return $modifiedRow;
                });

This can be refactored by creating another class::

        class TotalOrderCalculator
        {

                public function __invoke($row, $key)
                {
                    if (!empty($row['items'])) {
                        $row['total'] = collection($row['items'])->sumOf('price');
                    }

                    if (!empty($row['total'])) {
                        $row['tax_amount'] = $row['total'] * 0.25;
                    }

                    // More code here...

                    return $modifiedRow;
                }
        }

        // Use the logic in your map() call
        $collection->map(new TotalOrderCalculator)


.. php:method:: through(callable $c)

Sometimes a chain of collection method calls can become reusable in other parts
of your application, but only if they are called in that specific order. In
those cases you can use ``through()`` in combination with a class implementing
``__invoke`` to distribute your handy data processing calls::

        $collection
                ->map(new ShippingCostCalculator)
                ->map(new TotalOrderCalculator)
                ->map(new GiftCardPriceReducer)
                ->buffered()
               ...

The above method calls can be extracted into a new class so they don't need to
be repeated every time::

        class FinalCheckOutRowProcessor
        {

                public function __invoke($collection)
                {
                        return $collection
                                ->map(new ShippingCostCalculator)
                                ->map(new TotalOrderCalculator)
                                ->map(new GiftCardPriceReducer)
                                ->buffered()
                               ...
                }
        }


        // Now you can use the through() method to call all methods at once
        $collection->through(new FinalCheckOutRowProcessor);

Optimizing Collections
----------------------

.. php:method:: buffered()

Collections often perform most operations that you create using its functions in
a lazy way. This means that even though you can call a function, it does not
mean it is executed right away. This is true for a great deal of functions in
this class. Lazy evaluation allows you to save resources in situations
where you don't use all the values in a collection. You might not use all the
values when iteration stops early, or when an exception/failure case is reached
early.

Additionally, lazy evaluation helps speed up some operations. Consider the
following example::

    $collection = new Collection($oneMillionItems);
    $collection->map(function ($item) {
        return $item * 2;
    });
    $itemsToShow = $collection->take(30);

Had the collections not been lazy, we would have executed one million operations,
even though we only wanted to show 30 elements out of it. Instead, our map
operation was only applied to the 30 elements we used. We can also
derive benefits from this lazy evaluation for smaller collections when we
do more than one operation on them. For example: calling ``map()`` twice and
then ``filter()``.

Lazy evaluation comes with its downside too. You could be doing the same
operations more than once if you optimize a collection prematurely. Consider
this example::

    $ages = $collection->extract('age');

    $youngerThan30 = $ages->filter(function ($item) {
        return $item < 30;
    });

    $olderThan30 = $ages->filter(function ($item) {
        return $item > 30;
    });

If we iterate both ``youngerThan30`` and ``olderThan30``, the collection would
unfortunately execute the ``extract()`` operation twice. This is because
collections are immutable and the lazy-extracting operation would be done for
both filters.

Luckily we can overcome this issue with a single function. If you plan to reuse
the values from certain operations more than once, you can compile the results
into another collection using the ``buffered()`` function::

    $ages = $collection->extract('age')->buffered();
    $youngerThan30 = ...
    $olderThan30 = ...

Now, when both collections are iterated, they will only call the
extracting operation once.

Making Collections Rewindable
-----------------------------

The ``buffered()`` method is also useful for converting non-rewindable iterators
into collections that can be iterated more than once::

    // In PHP 5.5+
    public function results()
    {
        ...
        foreach ($transientElements as $e) {
            yield $e;
        }
    }
    $rewindable = (new Collection(results()))->buffered();

Cloning Collections
-------------------

.. php:method:: compile(bool $preserveKeys = true)

Sometimes you need to get a clone of the elements from another
collection. This is useful when you need to iterate the same set from different
places at the same time. In order to clone a collection out of another use the
``compile()`` method::

    $ages = $collection->extract('age')->compile();

    foreach ($ages as $age) {
        foreach ($collection as $element) {
            echo h($element->name) . ' - ' . $age;
        }
    }
