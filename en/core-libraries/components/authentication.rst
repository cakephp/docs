Authentication
##############

.. php:class:: AuthComponent(ComponentCollection $collection, array $settings = array())

Identifying, authenticating and authorizing users is a common part of
almost every web application.  In CakePHP AuthComponent provides a
pluggable way to do these tasks.  AuthComponent allows you to combine
authentication objects, and authorization objects to create flexible
ways of identifying and checking user authorization.

.. _authentication-objects:

Authentication
==============

Authentication is the process of identifying users by provided
credentials and ensuring that users are who they say they are.
Generally this is done through a username and password, that are checked
against a known list of users. In CakePHP, there are several built in
ways of authenticating users stored in your application.

* ``FormAuthenticate`` allows you to authenticate users based on form POST
  data.  Usually this is a login form that users enter information into.
* ``BasicAuthenticate`` allows you to authenticate users using Basic HTTP
  authentication.
* ``DigestAuthenticate`` allows you to authenticate users using Digest
  HTTP authentication.

By default ``AuthComponent`` uses ``FormAuthenticate``.

Choosing an Authentication type
-------------------------------

Generally you'll want to offer form based authenitcation. It is the easiest for
users using a web-browser to use.  If you are building an API or webservice, you
may want to consider basic authentication or digest authentication.  The key
differences between digest and basic authentication are mostly related to how
passwords are handled.  In basic authentication, the username and password are
transmitted as plain-text to the server.  This makes basic authentication
un-suitable for applications without SSL, as you would end up exposing sensitive
passwords.  Digest authentication uses a digest hash of the username, password,
and a few other details.  This makes digest authentication more appropriate for
applications without SSL encryption.

You can also use authentication systems like openid as well, however openid is
not part of CakePHP core.

Configuring Authentication handlers
-----------------------------------

You configure authentication handlers using ``$this->Auth->authenticate``.
You can configure one or many handlers for authentication.  Using
multiple handlers allows you to support different ways of logging users
in.  When logging users in, authentication handlers are checked in the
order they are declared.  Once one handler is able to identify the user,
no other handlers will be checked.  Conversely you can halt all
authentication by throwing an exception.  You will need to catch any
thrown exceptions, and handle them as needed.

You can configure authentication handlers in your controller's
``beforeFilter`` or, in the ``$components`` array.  You can pass
configuration information into each authentication object, using an
array::

    <?php
    // Basic setup
    $this->Auth->authenticate = array('Form');

    // Pass settings in
    $this->Auth->authenticate = array(
        'Form' => array('userModel' => 'Users.User'),
        'Basic' => array('userModel' => 'Users.User')
    );

In the second example you'll notice that we had to declare the
``userModel`` key twice. To help you keep your code DRY, you can use the
``all`` key.  This special key allows you to set settings that are passed
to every attached object.  The all key is also exposed as
``AuthComponent::ALL``::

    <?php
    // Pass settings in using 'all'
    $this->Auth->authenticate = array(
        AuthComponent::ALL => array('userModel' => 'Users.User'),
        'Form',
        'Basic'
    );

In the above example, both ``Form`` and ``Basic`` will get the settings
defined for the 'all' key.  Any settings passed to a specific
authentication object will override the matching key in the 'all' key.
The core authentication objects support the following configuration
keys.

- ``fields`` The fields to use to identify a user by.
- ``userModel`` The model name of the User, defaults to User.
- ``scope`` Additional conditions to use when looking up and
  authenticating users, i.e. ``array('User.is_active' => 1).``

To configure different fields for user in ``$components`` array::

    <?php
    // Pass settings in $components array
    public $components = array(
        'Auth' => array(
            'authenticate' => array(
                'Form' => array(
                    'fields' => array('username' => 'email')
                )
            )
        )
    );

.. note::

    Do not put other Auth configuration keys (like authError, loginAction etc)
    within the authenticate or Form element. They should be at the same level as
    the authenticate key.
    Above setup with other Auth configurations should look something like::

        <?php
        // Pass settings in $components array
        public $components = array(
            'Auth' => array(
                'loginAction' => array(
                    'controller' => 'users',
                    'action' => 'login',
                    'plugin' => 'users'
                ),
                'authError' => 'Did you really think you are allowed to see that?',
                'authenticate' => array(
                    'Form' => array(
                        'fields' => array('username' => 'email')
                    )
                )
            )
        );

In addition to the common configuration, Basic authentication supports
the following keys:

- ``realm`` The realm being authenticated. Defaults to ``env('SERVER_NAME')``.

In addition to the common configuration Digest authentication supports
the following keys:

- ``realm`` The realm authentication is for, Defaults to the servername.
- ``nonce`` A nonce used for authentication.  Defaults to ``uniqid()``.
- ``qop`` Defaults to auth, no other values are supported at this time.
- ``opaque`` A string that must be returned unchanged by clients. Defaults
  to ``md5($settings['realm'])``

Creating Custom Authentication objects
--------------------------------------

Because authentication objects are pluggable, you can create custom
authentication objects in your application or plugins.  If for example
you wanted to create an OpenID authentication object.  In
``app/Controller/Component/Auth/OpenidAuthenticate.php`` you could put
the following::

    <?php
    App::uses('BaseAuthenticate', 'Controller/Component/Auth');

    class OpenidAuthenticate extends BaseAuthenticate {
        public function authenticate(CakeRequest $request, CakeResponse $response) {
            // Do things for openid here.
        }
    }

Authentication objects should return ``false`` if they cannot identify the
user.  And an array of user information if they can. It's not required
that you extend ``BaseAuthenticate``, only that your authentication object
implements an ``authenticate()`` method.  The ``BaseAuthenticate`` class
provides a number of helpful methods that are commonly used.  You can
also implement a ``getUser()`` method if your authentication object needs
to support stateless or cookie-less authentication. See the sections on
basic and digest authentication below for more information.

Using custom authentication objects
-----------------------------------

Once you've created your custom authentication object, you can use them
by including them in AuthComponents authenticate array::

    <?php
    $this->Auth->authenticate = array(
        'Openid', // app authentication object.
        'AuthBag.Combo', // plugin authentication object.
    );


Identifying users and logging them in
-------------------------------------

In the past ``AuthComponent`` auto-magically logged users in.  This was
confusing for many people, and made using AuthComponent a bit difficult
at times.  For 2.0, you'll need to manually call ``$this->Auth->login()``
to log a user in.

When authenticating users, attached authentication objects are checked
in the order they are attached.  Once one of the objects can identify
the user, no other objects are checked.  A sample login function for
working with a login form could look like::

    <?php
    public function login() {
        if ($this->request->is('post')) {
            if ($this->Auth->login()) {
                return $this->redirect($this->Auth->redirect());
            } else {
                $this->Session->setFlash(__('Username or password is incorrect'), 'default', array(), 'auth');
            }
        }
    }

The above code (without any data passed to the ``login`` method), will attempt to log a user in using
the POST data, and if successful redirect the user to either the last page they were visiting,
or :php:attr:`AuthComponent::$loginRedirect`.  If the login is unsuccessful, a flash message is set.

.. warning::

    In 2.0 ``$this->Auth->login($this->request->data)`` will log the user in with whatever data is posted,
    whereas in 1.3 ``$this->Auth->login($this->data)`` would try to identify the user first and only log in
    when successful.

Using Digest and Basic Authentication for logging in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because basic and digest authentication don't require an initial POST to
be performed before they initiate the login sequence, your ``login()``
function will look a bit different than when using
``FormAuthentication``::

    <?php
    public function login() {
        if ($this->Auth->login()) {
            return $this->redirect($this->Auth->redirect());
        } else {
            $this->Session->setFlash(__('Username or password is incorrect'), 'default', array(), 'auth');
        }
    }

Once logged in, users using digest and basic auth are not required to
have cookies.  In fact, all authentication objects are able to provide
*stateless* authentication through implementing the ``getUser()`` method.
If the client supports cookies, basic and digest auth will store a user
in session much like any other authentication object.  If a client
doesn't support cookies, (such as a simple HTTP client built on top of
CURL) stateless authentication is also supported.  Stateless
authentication will re-verify the user's credentials on each request,
this creates a small amount of additional overhead, but allows clients
that cannot or do not support cookies to login in.

Creating stateless authentication systems
-----------------------------------------

Authentication objects can implement a ``getUser()`` method that can be
used to support user login systems that don't rely on cookies.  A
typical getUser method looks at the request/environment and uses the
information there to confirm the identity of the user.  HTTP Basic
authentication for example uses ``$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER]`` and
``$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW]`` for the username and password fields.  On each
request, if a client doesn't support cookies, these values are used to
re-identify the user and ensure they are valid user.  As with
authentication object's ``authenticate()`` method the ``getUser()`` method
should return an array of user information on success, and ``false`` on
failure.::

    <?php
    public function getUser($request) {
        $username = env('PHP_AUTH_USER');
        $pass = env('PHP_AUTH_PW');

        if (empty($username) || empty($pass)) {
            return false;
        }
        return $this->_findUser($username, $pass);
    }

The above is how you could implement getUser method for HTTP basic
authentication.  The ``_findUser()`` method is part of ``BaseAuthenticate``
and identifies a user based on a username and password.


Displaying auth related flash messages
--------------------------------------

In order to display the session error messages that Auth generates, you
need to add the following code to your layout. Add the following two
lines to the ``app/View/Layouts/default.ctp`` file in the body section
preferable before the content_for_layout line.::

    <?php
    echo $this->Session->flash();
    echo $this->Session->flash('auth');
    ?>

You can customize the error messages, and flash settings AuthComponent
uses.  Using ``$this->Auth->flash`` you can configure the parameters
AuthComponent uses for setting flash messages.  The available keys are

- ``element`` - The element to use, defaults to 'default'.
- ``key`` - The key to use, defaults to 'auth'
- ``params`` - The array of additional params to use, defaults to array()

In addition to the flash message settings you can customize other error
messages AuthComponent uses. In your controller's beforeFilter, or
component settings you can use ``authError`` to customize the error used
for when authorization fails::

    <?php
    $this->Auth->authError = "This error shows up with the user tries to access a part of the website that is protected.";

Hashing passwords
-----------------

AuthComponent no longer automatically hashes every password it can find.
This was removed because it made a number of common tasks like
validation difficult.  You should **never** store plain text passwords,
and before saving a user record you should always hash the password.
You can use the static ``AuthComponent::password()`` to hash passwords
before saving them.  This will use the configured hashing strategy for
your application.

After validating the password, you can hash a password in the beforeSave
callback of your model::

    <?php
    class User extends AppModel {
        function beforeSave($options = array()) {
            $this->data['User']['password'] = AuthComponent::password($this->data['User']['password']);
            return true;
        }
    }

You don't need to hash passwords before calling ``$this->Auth->login()``.
The various authentication objects will hash passwords individually. If
you are using Digest authentication, use should not use
AuthComponent::password() for generating passwords.  See below for how
to generate digest hashes.


Hashing passwords for digest authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because Digest authentication requires a password hashed in the format
defined by the RFC.  In order to correctly hash a password for use with
Digest authentication you should use the special password hashing
function on ``DigestAuthenticate``.  If you are going to be combining
digest authentication with any other authentication strategies, it's also
recommended that you store the digest password in a separate column,
from the normal password hash::

    <?php
    class User extends AppModel {
        function beforeSave($options = array()) {
            // make a password for digest auth.
            $this->data['User']['digest_hash'] = DigestAuthenticate::password(
                $this->data['User']['username'], $this->data['User']['password'], env('SERVER_NAME')
            );
            return true;
        }
    }

Passwords for digest authentication need a bit more information than
other password hashes, based on the RFC for digest authentication. If
you use AuthComponent::password() for digest hashes you will not be able
to login.

.. note::

    The third parameter of DigestAuthenticate::password() must match the
    'realm' config value defined when DigestAuthentication was
    configured in AuthComponent::$authenticate.  This defaults to
    ``env('SCRIPT_NAME)``.  You may wish to use a static string if you
    want consistent hashes in multiple environments.

Manually logging users in
-------------------------

Sometimes the need arises where you need to manually log a user in, such
as just after they registered for your application.  You can do this by
calling ``$this->Auth->login()`` with the user data you want to 'login'::

    <?php
    public function register() {
        if ($this->User->save($this->request->data)) {
            $id = $this->User->id;
            $this->request->data['User'] = array_merge($this->request->data["User"], array('id' => $id));
            $this->Auth->login($this->request->data['User']);
            $this->redirect('/users/home');
        }
    }

.. warning::

    Be sure to manually add the new User id to the array passed to the login
    method. Otherwise you won't have the user id available.

Accessing the logged in user
----------------------------

Once a user is logged in, you will often need some particular
information about the current user.  You can access the currently logged
in user using ``AuthComponent::user()``.  This method is static, and can
be used globally after the AuthComponent has been loaded. You can access
it both as an instance method or as a static method::

    <?php
    // Use anywhere
    AuthComponent::user('id')

    // From inside a controller
    $this->Auth->user('id');


Logging users out
-----------------

Eventually you'll want a quick way to de-authenticate someone, and
redirect them to where they need to go. This method is also useful if
you want to provide a 'Log me out' link inside a members' area of your
application::

    <?php
    public function logout() {
        $this->redirect($this->Auth->logout());
    }

Logging out users that logged in with Digest or Basic auth is difficult
to accomplish for all clients.  Most browsers will retain credentials
for the duration they are still open.  Some clients can be forced to
logout by sending a 401 status code.  Changing the authentication realm
is another solution that works for some clients.

.. _authorization-objects:

Authorization
=============

Authorization is the process of ensuring that an
identified/authenticated user is allowed to access the resources they
are requesting.  If enabled ``AuthComponent`` can automatically check
authorization handlers and ensure that logged in users are allowed to
access the resources they are requesting.  There are several built-in
authorization handlers, and you can create custom ones for your
application, or as part of a plugin.

- ``ActionsAuthorize`` Uses the AclComponent to check for permissions on
  an action level.
- ``CrudAuthorize`` Uses the AclComponent and action -> CRUD mappings to
  check permissions for resources.
- ``ControllerAuthorize`` Calls ``isAuthorized()`` on the active controller,
  and uses the return of that to authorize a user.  This is often the
  most simple way to authorize users.

Configuring Authorization handlers
----------------------------------

You configure authorization handlers using ``$this->Auth->authorize``.
You can configure one or many handlers for authorization.  Using
multiple handlers allows you to support different ways of checking
authorization.  When authorization handlers are checked, they will be
called in the order they are declared.  Handlers should return false, if
they are unable to check authorization, or the check has failed.
Handlers should return true if they were able to check authorization
successfully. Handlers will be called in sequence until one passes.  If
all checks fail, the user will be redirected to the page they came from.
Additionally you can halt all authorization by throwing an exception.
You will need to catch any thrown exceptions, and handle them.

You can configure authorization handlers in your controller's
``beforeFilter`` or, in the ``$components`` array.  You can pass
configuration information into each authorization object, using an
array::

    <?php
    // Basic setup
    $this->Auth->authorize = array('Controller');

    // Pass settings in
    $this->Auth->authorize = array(
        'Actions' => array('actionPath' => 'controllers/'),
        'Controller'
    );

Much like ``Auth->authenticate``,  ``Auth->authorize``, allows helps you
keep your code DRY, by using the ``all`` key.  This special key allows you
to set settings that are passed to every attached object.  The all key
is also exposed as ``AuthComponent::ALL``::

    <?php
    // Pass settings in using 'all'
    $this->Auth->authorize = array(
        AuthComponent::ALL => array('actionPath' => 'controllers/'),
        'Actions',
        'Controller'
    );

In the above example, both the ``Actions`` and ``Controller`` will get the
settings defined for the 'all' key.  Any settings passed to a specific
authentication object will override the matching key in the 'all' key.
The core authorize objects support the following configuration keys.

- ``actionPath`` Used by ``ActionsAuthorize`` to locate controller action
  ACO's in the ACO tree.
- ``actionMap`` Action -> CRUD mappings.  Used by ``CrudAuthorize`` and
  authorization objects that want to map actions to CRUD roles.
- ``userModel`` The name of  the ARO/Model node user information can be found
  under.  Used with ActionsAuthorize,


Creating Custom Authorize objects
---------------------------------

Because authorize objects are pluggable, you can create custom authorize
objects in your application or plugins.  If for example you wanted to
create an LDAP authorize object.  In
``app/Controller/Component/Auth/LdapAuthorize.php`` you could put the
following::

    <?php
    App::uses('BaseAuthorize', 'Controller/Component/Auth');

    class LdapAuthorize extends BaseAuthorize {
        public function authorize($user, CakeRequest $request); {
            // Do things for ldap here.
        }
    }

Authorize objects should return ``false`` if the user is denied access, or
if the object is unable to perform a check.  If the object is able to
verify the user's access, ``true`` should be returned. It's not required
that you extend ``BaseAuthorize``, only that your authorize object
implements an ``authorize()`` method.  The ``BaseAuthorize`` class provides
a number of helpful methods that are commonly used.

Using custom authorize objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you've created your custom authorize object, you can use them by
including them in AuthComponents authorize array::

    <?php
    $this->Auth->authorize = array(
        'Ldap', // app authorize object.
        'AuthBag.Combo', // plugin authorize object.
    );

Using no authorization
----------------------

If you'd like to not use any of the built-in authorization objects, and
want to handle things entirely outside of AuthComponent you can set
``$this->Auth->authorize = false;``.  By default AuthComponent starts off
with ``authorize = false``.  If you don't use an authorization scheme,
make sure to check authorization yourself in your controller's
beforeFilter, or with another component.


Making actions public
---------------------

There are often times controller actions that you wish to remain
entirely public, or that don't require users to be logged in.
AuthComponent is pessimistic, and defaults to denying access. You can
mark actions as public actions by using ``AuthComponent::allow()``.  By
marking actions as public, AuthComponent, will not check for a logged in
user, nor will authorize objects be checked::

    <?php
    // Allow all actions.
    $this->Auth->allow('*');

    // Allow only the view and index actions.
    $this->Auth->allow('view', 'index');

    // Allow only the view and index actions.
    $this->Auth->allow(array('view', 'index'));

You can provide as many action names as you need to ``allow()``.  You can
also supply an array containing all the action names.

Making actions require authorization
------------------------------------

If after making actions public, you want to revoke the public access.
You can do so using ``AuthComponent::deny()``::

    <?php
    // remove one action
    $this->Auth->deny('add');

    // remove all the actions.
    $this->Auth->deny();

    // remove a group of actions.
    $this->Auth->deny('add', 'edit');
    $this->Auth->deny(array('add', 'edit'));

You can provide as many action names as you need to ``deny()``.  You can
also supply an array containing all the action names.

Mapping actions when using CrudAuthorize
----------------------------------------

When using CrudAuthorize or any other authorize objects that use action
mappings, it is might be necessary to map additional methods.  You can
map actions -> CRUD permissions using mapAction().  Calling this on
AuthComponent will delegate to all the of the configured authorize
objects, so you can be sure the settings were applied every where::

    <?php
    $this->Auth->mapActions(array(
        'create' => array('register'),
        'view' => array('show', 'display')
    ));

The keys for mapActions should be the CRUD permissions you want to set,
while the values should be an array of all the actions that are mapped
to the CRUD permission.

Using ControllerAuthorize
-------------------------

ControllerAuthorize allows you to handle authorization checks in a
controller callback.  This is ideal when you have very simple
authorization, or you need to use a combination of models + components
to do your authorization, and don't want to create a custom authorize
object.

The callback is always called ``isAuthorized()`` and it should return a
boolean as to whether or not the user is allowed to access resources in
the request.  The callback is passed the active user, so it can be
checked::

    <?php
    class AppController extends Controller {
        function isAuthorized($user) {
            if (isset($this->request->params['admin'])) {
                return (bool)($user['role'] == 'admin')
            }
            return true;
        }
    }

The above callback would provide a very simple authorization system
where, only users with role = admin could access actions that were in
the admin prefix.


Using ActionsAuthorize
----------------------

ActionsAuthorize integrates with the AclComponent, and provides a fine
grained per action ACL check on each request.  ActionsAuthorize is often
paired with DbAcl to give dynamic and flexible permission systems that
can be edited by admin users through the application.  It can however,
be combined with other Acl implementations such as IniAcl and custom
application Acl backends.

Using CrudAuthorize
-------------------

``CrudAuthorize`` integrates with AclComponent, and provides the ability to
map requests to CRUD operations.  Provides the ability to authorize
using CRUD mappings. These mapped results are then checked in the
AclComponent as specific permissions.

For example, taking ``/posts/index`` as the current request.  The default
mapping for ``index``, is a ``read`` permission check. The Acl check would
then be for the ``posts`` controller with the ``read`` permission.  This
allows you to create permission systems that focus more on what is being
done to resources, rather than the specific actions being visited.

AuthComponent API
=================

AuthComponent is the primary interface to the built-in authorization
and authentication mechanics in CakePHP.

.. php:attr:: ajaxLogin

    The name of an optional view element to render when an Ajax request is made
    with an invalid or expired session

.. php:attr: allowedActions

    Controller actions for which user validation is not required.

.. php:attr:: authenticate

    Set to an array of Authentication objects you want to use when
    logging users in. There are several core authentication objects,
    see the section on :ref:`authentication-objects`

.. php:attr:: authError

    Error to display when user attempts to access an object or action to which 
    they do not have access.

.. php:attr:: authorize

    Set to an array of Authorization objects you want to use when
    authorizing users on each request, see the section on
    :ref:`authorization-objects`

.. php:attr:: components

    Other components utilized by AuthComponent

.. php:attr:: flash

    Settings to use when Auth needs to do a flash message with 
    :php:meth:`SessionComponent::setFlash()`.
    Available keys are:

    - ``element`` - The element to use, defaults to 'default'.
    - ``key`` - The key to use, defaults to 'auth'
    - ``params`` - The array of additional params to use, defaults to array()

.. php:attr:: loginAction

    A URL (defined as a string or array) to the controller action that handles
    logins.  Defaults to `/users/login`

.. php:attr:: loginRedirect

    The URL (defined as a string or array) to the controller action users 
    should be redirected to after logging in. This value will be ignored if the 
    user has an ``Auth.redirect`` value in their session.

.. php:attr:: logoutRedirect

    The default action to redirect to after the user is logged out. While 
    AuthComponent does not handle post-logout redirection, a redirect URL will 
    be returned from :php:meth:`AuthComponent::logout()`. Defaults to 
    :php:attr:`AuthComponent::$loginAction`.

.. php:attr:: request

    Request object

.. php:attr:: response

    Response object

.. php:attr:: sessionKey
