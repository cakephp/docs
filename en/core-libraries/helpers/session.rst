SessionHelper
#############

.. php:class:: SessionHelper(View $view, array $settings = array())

As a natural counterpart to the Session Component, the Session
Helper replicates most of the components functionality and makes it
available in your view. The Session Helper is no longer
automatically added to your view â€” so it is necessary to add it to
the ``$helpers`` array in your controller.

The major difference between the Session Helper and the Session
Component is that the helper does *not* have the ability to write
to the session.

As with the Session Component, data is read by using
:term:`dot notation` array structures::

    <?php
    array('User' => array(
        'username' => 'super@example.com'
    ));

Given the previous array structure, the node would be accessed by
``User.username``, with the dot indicating the nested array. This
notation is used for all Session helper methods wherever a ``$key`` is
used.

.. php:method:: read(string $key)

    :rtype: mixed

    Read from the Session. Returns a string or array depending on the
    contents of the session.

.. php:method:: check(string $key)

    :rtype: boolean

    Check to see if a key is in the Session. Returns a boolean on the
    key's existence.

.. php:method:: error()

    :rtype: string

    Returns last error encountered in a session.

.. php:method:: valid()

    :rtype: boolean

    Used to check is a session is valid in a view.

Displaying notifications or flash messages
==========================================

.. php:method:: flash(string $key = 'flash', array $params = array())

    :rtype: string

    As explained in :ref:`creating-notification-messages` you can
    create one-time notifications for feedback. After creating messages 
    with :php:meth:`SessionComponent::setFlash()` you will want to 
    display them. Once a message is displayed, it will be removed and 
    not displayed again::

        <?php
        echo $this->Session->flash();

    The above will output a simple message, with the following html::

        <div id="flashMessage" class="message">
            Your stuff has been saved.
        </div>

    As with the component method you can set additional properties
    and customize which element is used. In the controller you might 
    have code like::

        <?php
        // in a controller
        $this->Session->setFlash('The user could not be deleted.');

    When outputting this message, you can choose the element used to display
    this message::

        <?php 
        // in a layout.
        echo $this->Session->flash('flash', array('element' => 'failure'));

    This would use ``View/Elements/failure.ctp`` to render the message.  The 
    message text would be available as ``$message`` in the element.

    Inside the failure element file would be something like
    this::

        <div class="flash flash-failure">
            <?php echo $message; ?>
        </div>

    You can also pass additional parameters into the ``flash()`` method, which
    allow you to generate customized messages::

        <?php
        // In the controller
        $this->Session->setFlash('Thanks for your payment %s');

        // In the layout.
        echo $this->Session->flash('flash', array(
            'params' => array('name' => $user['User']['name'])
            'element' => 'payment'
        ));
        
        // View/Elements/payment.ctp
        <div class="flash payment">
            <?php printf($message, h($name)); ?>
        </div>
