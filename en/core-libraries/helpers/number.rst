NumberHelper
############

.. php:class:: NumberHelper(View $view, array $settings = array())

The NumberHelper contains convenience methods that enable display
numbers in common formats in your views. These methods include ways
to format currency, percentages, data sizes, format numbers to
specific precisions and also to give you more flexibility with
formatting numbers.

.. versionchanged:: 2.1
   ``NumberHelper`` have been refactored into :php:class:`CakeNumber` class to
   allow easier use outside of the ``View`` layer.
   Within a view, these methods are accessible via the ``NumberHelper``
   class and you can call it as you would call a normal helper method:
   ``$this->Number->method($args);``.
