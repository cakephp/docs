JsHelper
########

.. php:class:: JsHelper(View $view, array $settings = array())

Since the beginning CakePHP's support for JavaScript has been with
Prototype/Scriptaculous. While we still think these are
excellent JavaScript libraries, the community has been asking for
support for other libraries. Rather than drop Prototype in favour
of another JavaScript library. We created an Adapter based helper,
and included 3 of the most requested libraries.
Prototype/Scriptaculous, Mootools/Mootools-more, and jQuery/jQuery
UI. While the API is not as expansive as the previous
AjaxHelper we feel that the adapter based solution allows for a
more extensible solution giving developers the power and
flexibility they need to address their specific application needs.

JavaScript Engines form the backbone of the new JsHelper. A
JavaScript engine translates an abstract JavaScript element into
concrete JavaScript code specific to the JavaScript library being
used. In addition they create an extensible system for others to
use.


Using a specific JavaScript engine
==================================

First of all download your preferred JavaScript library and place
it in ``app/webroot/js``

Then you must include the library in your page. To include it in
all pages, add this line to the <head> section of
``app/View/Layouts/default.ctp`` (copy this file from
``lib/Cake/View/Layouts/default.ctp`` if you have not created your
own)::

    echo $this->Html->script('jquery'); // Include jQuery library

Replace ``jquery`` with the name of your library file (.js will be
added to the name).

By default scripts are cached, and you must explicitly print out
the cache. To do this at the end of each page, include this line
just before the ending ``</body>`` tag::

    echo $this->Js->writeBuffer(); // Write cached scripts

.. warning::

    You must include the library in your page and print the cache for
    the helper to function.

JavaScript engine selection is declared when you include the helper
in your controller::

    public $helpers = array('Js' => array('Jquery'));

The above would use the Jquery Engine in the instances of JsHelper
in your views. If you do not declare a specific engine, the jQuery
engine will be used as the default. As mentioned before, there are
three engines implemented in the core, but we encourage the
community to expand the library compatibility.

Using jQuery with other libraries
---------------------------------

The jQuery library, and virtually all of its plugins are
constrained within the jQuery namespace. As a general rule,
"global" objects are stored inside the jQuery namespace as well, so
you shouldn't get a clash between jQuery and any other library
(like Prototype, MooTools, or YUI).

That said, there is one caveat:
**By default, jQuery uses "$" as a shortcut for "jQuery"**

To override the "$" shortcut, use the jQueryObject variable::

    $this->Js->JqueryEngine->jQueryObject = '$j';
    echo $this->Html->scriptBlock(
        'var $j = jQuery.noConflict();', 
        array('inline' => false)
    );
    // Tell jQuery to go into noconflict mode

Using the JsHelper inside customHelpers
---------------------------------------

Declare the JsHelper in the ``$helpers`` array in your
customHelper::

    public $helpers = array('Js');

.. note::

    It is not possible to declare a JavaScript engine inside a custom
    helper. Doing that will have no effect.

If you are willing to use an other JavaScript engine than the
default, do the helper setup in your controller as follows::

    public $helpers = array(
        'Js' => array('Prototype'),
        'CustomHelper'
    );


.. warning::

    Be sure to declare the JsHelper and its engine **on top** of the
    ``$helpers`` array in your controller.

The selected JavaScript engine may disappear (replaced by the
default) from the jsHelper object in your helper, if you miss to do
so and you will get code that does not fit your JavaScript
library.

Creating a JavaScript Engine
============================

JavaScript engine helpers follow normal helper conventions, with a
few additional restrictions. They must have the ``Engine`` suffix.
``DojoHelper`` is not good, ``DojoEngineHelper`` is correct.
Furthermore, they should extend ``JsBaseEngineHelper`` in order to
leverage the most of the new API.

JavaScript engine usage
=======================

The ``JsHelper`` provides a few methods, and acts as a facade for
the the Engine helper. You should not directly access the Engine
helper except in rare occasions. Using the facade features of the
``JsHelper`` allows you to leverage the buffering and method
chaining features built-in; (method chaining only works in PHP5).

The ``JsHelper`` by default buffers almost all script code
generated, allowing you to collect scripts throughout the view,
elements and layout, and output it in one place. Outputting
buffered scripts is done with ``$this->Js->writeBuffer();`` this
will return the buffer contents in a script tag. You can disable
buffering wholesale with the ``$bufferScripts`` property or setting
``buffer => false`` in methods taking ``$options``.

Since most methods in JavaScript begin with a selection of elements
in the DOM, ``$this->Js->get()`` returns a $this, allowing you to
chain the methods using the selection. Method chaining allows you
to write shorter, more expressive code::
 
    $this->Js->get('#foo')->event('click', $eventCode);

Is an example of method chaining. Method chaining is not possible
in PHP4 and the above sample would be written like::

    $this->Js->get('#foo');
    $this->Js->event('click', $eventCode);

Common options
--------------

In attempts to simplify development where Js libraries can change,
a common set of options is supported by ``JsHelper``, these common
options will be mapped out to the library specific options
internally. If you are not planning on switching JavaScript
libraries, each library also supports all of its native callbacks
and options.

Callback wrapping
-----------------

By default all callback options are wrapped with the an anonymous
function with the correct arguments. You can disable this behavior
by supplying the ``wrapCallbacks = false`` in your options array.

Working with buffered scripts
-----------------------------

One drawback to previous implementation of 'Ajax' type features was
the scattering of script tags throughout your document, and the
inability to buffer scripts added by elements in the layout. The
new JsHelper if used correctly avoids both of those issues. It is
recommended that you place ``$this->Js->writeBuffer()`` at the
bottom of your layout file above the ``</body>`` tag. This will
allow all scripts generated in layout elements to be output in one
place. It should be noted that buffered scripts are handled
separately from included script files.

.. php:method:: writeBuffer($options = array())

Writes all JavaScript generated so far to a code block or caches
them to a file and returns a linked script.

**Options**

-  ``inline`` - Set to true to have scripts output as a script
   block inline if ``cache`` is also true, a script link tag will be
   generated. (default true)
-  ``cache`` - Set to true to have scripts cached to a file and
   linked in (default false)
-  ``clear`` - Set to false to prevent script cache from being
   cleared (default true)
-  ``onDomReady`` - wrap cached scripts in domready event (default
   true)
-  ``safe`` - if an inline block is generated should it be wrapped
   in <![CDATA[ ... ]]> (default true)

Creating a cache file with ``writeBuffer()`` requires that
``webroot/js`` be world writable and allows a browser to cache
generated script resources for any page.

.. php:method:: buffer($content)

Add ``$content`` to the internal script buffer.

.. php:method:: getBuffer($clear = true)

Get the contents of the current buffer. Pass in false to not clear
the buffer at the same time.

**Buffering methods that are not normally buffered**

Some methods in the helpers are buffered by default. The engines
buffer the following methods by default:

-  event
-  sortable
-  drag
-  drop
-  slider

Additionally you can force any other method in JsHelper to use the
buffering. By appending an boolean to the end of the arguments you
can force other methods to go into the buffer. For example the
``each()`` method does not normally buffer::

    $this->Js->each('alert("whoa!");', true);

The above would force the ``each()`` method to use the buffer.
Conversely if you want a method that does buffer to not buffer, you
can pass a ``false`` in as the last argument::

    $this->Js->event('click', 'alert("whoa!");', false);

This would force the event function which normally buffers to
return its result.

Other Methods
=============

The core JavaScript Engines provide the same feature set across all
libraries, there is also a subset of common options that are
translated into library specific options. This is done to provide
end developers with as unified an API as possible. The following
list of methods are supported by all the Engines included in the
CakePHP core. Whenever you see separate lists for ``Options`` and
``Event Options`` both sets of parameters are supplied in the
``$options`` array for the method.

.. php:method:: object($data, $options = array())

    Serializes ``$data`` into JSON.  This method is a proxy for ``json_encode()``
    with a few extra features added via the ``$options`` parameter.

    **Options:**

    -  ``prefix`` - String prepended to the returned data.
    -  ``postfix`` - String appended to the returned data.

    **Example Use**::
    
        $json = $this->Js->object($data);

.. php:method:: sortable($options = array())

    Sortable generates a JavaScript snippet to make a set of elements
    (usually a list) drag and drop sortable.

    The normalized options are:

    **Options**

    -  ``containment`` - Container for move action
    -  ``handle`` - Selector to handle element. Only this element will
       start sort action.
    -  ``revert`` - Whether or not to use an effect to move sortable
       into final position.
    -  ``opacity`` - Opacity of the placeholder
    -  ``distance`` - Distance a sortable must be dragged before
       sorting starts.

    **Event Options**

    -  ``start`` - Event fired when sorting starts
    -  ``sort`` - Event fired during sorting
    -  ``complete`` - Event fired when sorting completes.

    Other options are supported by each JavaScript library, and you
    should check the documentation for your JavaScript library for more
    detailed information on its options and parameters.

    **Example Use**::
    
        $this->Js->get('#my-list');
        $this->Js->sortable(array(
            'distance' => 5,
            'containment' => 'parent',
            'start' => 'onStart',
            'complete' => 'onStop',
            'sort' => 'onSort',
            'wrapCallbacks' => false
        ));

    Assuming you were using the jQuery engine, you would get the
    following code in your generated JavaScript block
    
    .. code-block:: javascript

        $("#myList").sortable({containment:"parent", distance:5, sort:onSort, start:onStart, stop:onStop});

.. php:method:: request($url, $options = array())

    Generate a JavaScript snippet to create an ``XmlHttpRequest`` or
    'AJAX' request.

    **Event Options**

    -  ``complete`` - Callback to fire on complete.
    -  ``success`` - Callback to fire on success.
    -  ``before`` - Callback to fire on request initialization.
    -  ``error`` - Callback to fire on request failure.

    **Options**

    -  ``method`` - The method to make the request with defaults to GET
       in more libraries
    -  ``async`` - Whether or not you want an asynchronous request.
    -  ``data`` - Additional data to send.
    -  ``update`` - Dom id to update with the content of the response.
    -  ``type`` - Data type for response. 'json' and 'html' are
       supported. Default is html for most libraries.
    -  ``evalScripts`` - Whether or not <script> tags should be
       eval'ed.
    -  ``dataExpression`` - Should the ``data`` key be treated as a
       callback. Useful for supplying ``$options['data']`` as another
       JavaScript expression.

    **Example use**::

        $this->Js->event(
            'click',
            $this->Js->request(
                array('action' => 'foo', 'param1'),
                array('async' => true, 'update' => '#element')
            )
        );

.. php:method:: get($selector)

    Set the internal 'selection' to a CSS selector. The active
    selection is used in subsequent operations until a new selection is
    made::
    
        $this->Js->get('#element');

    The ``JsHelper`` now will reference all other element based methods
    on the selection of ``#element``. To change the active selection,
    call ``get()`` again with a new element.

.. php:method:: set(mixed $one, mixed $two = null)

    Pass variables into JavaScript. Allows you to set variables that will be 
    output when the buffer is fetched with :php:meth:`JsHelper::getBuffer()` or 
    :php:meth:`JsHelper::writeBuffer()`. The JavaScript variable used to output 
    set variables can be controlled with :php:attr:`JsHelper::$setVariable`.

.. php:method:: drag($options = array())

    Make an element draggable.

    **Options**

    -  ``handle`` - selector to the handle element.
    -  ``snapGrid`` - The pixel grid that movement snaps to, an
       array(x, y)
    -  ``container`` - The element that acts as a bounding box for the
       draggable element.

    **Event Options**

    -  ``start`` - Event fired when the drag starts
    -  ``drag`` - Event fired on every step of the drag
    -  ``stop`` - Event fired when dragging stops (mouse release)

    **Example use**::

        $this->Js->get('#element');
        $this->Js->drag(array(
            'container' => '#content',
            'start' => 'onStart',
            'drag' => 'onDrag',
            'stop' => 'onStop',
            'snapGrid' => array(10, 10),
            'wrapCallbacks' => false
        ));

    If you were using the jQuery engine the following code would be
    added to the buffer
    
    .. code-block:: javascript

        $("#element").draggable({containment:"#content", drag:onDrag, grid:[10,10], start:onStart, stop:onStop});

.. php:method:: drop($options = array())

    Make an element accept draggable elements and act as a dropzone for
    dragged elements.

    **Options**

    -  ``accept`` - Selector for elements this droppable will accept.
    -  ``hoverclass`` - Class to add to droppable when a draggable is
       over.

    **Event Options**

    -  ``drop`` - Event fired when an element is dropped into the drop
       zone.
    -  ``hover`` - Event fired when a drag enters a drop zone.
    -  ``leave`` - Event fired when a drag is removed from a drop zone
       without being dropped.

    **Example use**::

        $this->Js->get('#element');
        $this->Js->drop(array(
            'accept' => '.items',
            'hover' => 'onHover',
            'leave' => 'onExit',
            'drop' => 'onDrop',
            'wrapCallbacks' => false
        ));

    If you were using the jQuery engine the following code would be
    added to the buffer
    
    .. code-block:: javascript

        $("#element").droppable({accept:".items", drop:onDrop, out:onExit, over:onHover});

    .. note::

        Droppables in Mootools function differently from other libraries.
        Droppables are implemented as an extension of Drag. So in addition
        to making a get() selection for the droppable element. You must
        also provide a selector rule to the draggable element. Furthermore,
        Mootools droppables inherit all options from Drag.

.. php:method:: slider($options = array())

    Create snippet of JavaScript that converts an element into a slider
    ui widget. See your libraries implementation for additional usage
    and features.

    **Options**

    -  ``handle`` - The id of the element used in sliding.
    -  ``direction`` - The direction of the slider either 'vertical' or
       'horizontal'
    -  ``min`` - The min value for the slider.
    -  ``max`` - The max value for the slider.
    -  ``step`` - The number of steps or ticks the slider will have.
    -  ``value`` - The initial offset of the slider.

    **Events**

    -  ``change`` - Fired when the slider's value is updated
    -  ``complete`` - Fired when the user stops sliding the handle

    **Example use**::

        $this->Js->get('#element');
        $this->Js->slider(array(
            'complete' => 'onComplete',
            'change' => 'onChange',
            'min' => 0,
            'max' => 10,
            'value' => 2,
            'direction' => 'vertical',
            'wrapCallbacks' => false
        ));

    If you were using the jQuery engine the following code would be
    added to the buffer
    
    .. code-block:: javascript

        $("#element").slider({change:onChange, max:10, min:0, orientation:"vertical", stop:onComplete, value:2});

.. php:method:: effect($name, $options = array())

    Creates a basic effect. By default this method is not buffered and
    returns its result.

    **Supported effect names**

    The following effects are supported by all JsEngines

    -  ``show`` - reveal an element.
    -  ``hide`` - hide an element.
    -  ``fadeIn`` - Fade in an element.
    -  ``fadeOut`` - Fade out an element.
    -  ``slideIn`` - Slide an element in.
    -  ``slideOut`` - Slide an element out.

    **Options**

    -  ``speed`` - Speed at which the animation should occur. Accepted
       values are 'slow', 'fast'. Not all effects use the speed option.

    **Example use**

    If you were using the jQuery engine::

        $this->Js->get('#element');
        $result = $this->Js->effect('fadeIn');

        // $result contains $("#foo").fadeIn();

.. php:method:: event($type, $content, $options = array())

    Bind an event to the current selection. ``$type`` can be any of the
    normal DOM events or a custom event type if your library supports
    them. ``$content`` should contain the function body for the
    callback. Callbacks will be wrapped with
    ``function (event) { ... }`` unless disabled with the
    ``$options``.

    **Options**

    -  ``wrap`` - Whether you want the callback wrapped in an anonymous
       function. (defaults to true)
    -  ``stop`` - Whether you want the event to stop. (defaults to
       true)

    **Example use**::
    
        $this->Js->get('#some-link');
        $this->Js->event('click', $this->Js->alert('hey you!'));

    If you were using the jQuery library you would get the following
    JavaScript code:
    
    .. code-block:: javascript

        $('#some-link').bind('click', function (event) {
            alert('hey you!');
            return false;
        });

    You can remove the ``return false;`` by passing setting the
    ``stop`` option to false::

        $this->Js->get('#some-link');
        $this->Js->event('click', $this->Js->alert('hey you!'), array('stop' => false));

    If you were using the jQuery library you would the following
    JavaScript code would be added to the buffer. Note that the default
    browser event is not cancelled:
    
    .. code-block:: javascript

        $('#some-link').bind('click', function (event) {
            alert('hey you!');
        });

.. php:method:: domReady($callback)

    Creates the special 'DOM ready' event. :php:func:`JsHelper::writeBuffer()`
    automatically wraps the buffered scripts in a domReady method.

.. php:method:: each($callback)

    Create a snippet that iterates over the currently selected
    elements, and inserts ``$callback``.

    **Example**::

        $this->Js->get('div.message');
        $this->Js->each('$(this).css({color: "red"});');

    Using the jQuery engine would create the following JavaScript:
    
    .. code-block:: javascript

        $('div.message').each(function () { $(this).css({color: "red"}); });

.. php:method:: alert($message)

    Create a JavaScript snippet containing an ``alert()`` snippet. By
    default, ``alert`` does not buffer, and returns the script
    snippet.::

        $alert = $this->Js->alert('Hey there');

.. php:method:: confirm($message)

    Create a JavaScript snippet containing a ``confirm()`` snippet. By
    default, ``confirm`` does not buffer, and returns the script
    snippet.::

        $alert = $this->Js->confirm('Are you sure?');

.. php:method:: prompt($message, $default)

    Create a JavaScript snippet containing a ``prompt()`` snippet. By
    default, ``prompt`` does not buffer, and returns the script
    snippet.::

        $prompt = $this->Js->prompt('What is your favorite color?', 'blue');

.. php:method:: submit($caption = null, $options = array())

    Create a submit input button that enables ``XmlHttpRequest``
    submitted forms. Options can include
    both those for :php:func:`FormHelper::submit()` and JsBaseEngine::request(),
    JsBaseEngine::event();

    Forms submitting with this method, cannot send files. Files do not
    transfer over ``XmlHttpRequest``
    and require an iframe, or other more specialized setups that are
    beyond the scope of this helper.

    **Options**

    -  ``url`` - The URL you wish the XHR request to submit to.
    -  ``confirm`` - Confirm message displayed before sending the
       request. Using confirm, does not replace any ``before`` callback
       methods in the generated XmlHttpRequest.
    -  ``buffer`` - Disable the buffering and return a script tag in
       addition to the link.
    -  ``wrapCallbacks`` - Set to false to disable automatic callback
       wrapping.

    **Example use**::

        echo $this->Js->submit('Save', array('update' => '#content'));

    Will create a submit button with an attached onclick event. The
    click event will be buffered by default.::

        echo $this->Js->submit('Save', array(
            'update' => '#content',
            'div' => false,
            'type' => 'json',
            'async' => false
        ));

    Shows how you can combine options that both
    :php:func:`FormHelper::submit()` and :php:func:`JsHelper::request()` when using submit.

.. php:method:: link($title, $url = null, $options = array())

    Create an HTML anchor element that has a click event bound to it.
    Options can include both those for :php:func:`HtmlHelper::link()` and
    :php:func:`JsHelper::request()`, :php:func:`JsHelper::event()`, ``$options``
    is a :term:`html attributes` array that are appended to the generated 
    anchor element. If an option is not part of the standard attributes 
    or ``$htmlAttributes`` it will be passed to :php:func:`JsHelper::request()` 
    as an option. If an id is not supplied, a randomly generated one will be
    created for each link generated.

    **Options**

    -  ``confirm`` - Generate a confirm() dialog before sending the
       event.
    -  ``id`` - use a custom id.
    -  ``htmlAttributes`` - additional non-standard htmlAttributes.
       Standard attributes are class, id, rel, title, escape, onblur and
       onfocus.
    -  ``buffer`` - Disable the buffering and return a script tag in
       addition to the link.

    **Example use**::

        echo $this->Js->link('Page 2', array('page' => 2), array('update' => '#content'));

    Will create a link pointing to ``/page:2`` and updating #content
    with the response.

    You can use the ``htmlAttributes`` option to add in additional
    custom attributes.::

        echo $this->Js->link('Page 2', array('page' => 2), array(
            'update' => '#content',
            'htmlAttributes' => array('other' => 'value')
        ));

    Outputs the following HTML:

    .. code-block:: html

        <a href="/posts/index/page:2" other="value">Page 2</a>

.. php:method:: serializeForm($options = array())

    Serialize the form attached to $selector. Pass ``true`` for $isForm
    if the current selection is a form element. Converts the form or
    the form element attached to the current selection into a
    string/json object (depending on the library implementation) for
    use with XHR operations.

    **Options**

    -  ``isForm`` - is the current selection a form, or an input?
       (defaults to false)
    -  ``inline`` - is the rendered statement going to be used inside
       another JS statement? (defaults to false)

    Setting inline == false allows you to remove the trailing ``;``.
    This is useful when you need to serialize a form element as part of
    another JavaScript operation, or use the serialize method in an
    Object literal.

.. php:method:: redirect($url)

    Redirect the page to ``$url`` using ``window.location``.

.. php:method:: value($value)

    Converts a PHP-native variable of any type to a JSON-equivalent
    representation. Escapes any string values into JSON compatible
    strings. UTF-8 characters will be escaped.

.. _ajax-pagination:

AJAX Pagination
===============

Much like AJAX Pagination in 1.2, you can use the JsHelper to
handle the creation of AJAX pagination links instead of plain HTML
links.

Making AJAX Links
-----------------

Before you can create AJAX links you must include the JavaScript
library that matches the adapter you are using with ``JsHelper``.
By default the ``JsHelper`` uses jQuery. So in your layout include
jQuery (or whichever library you are using). Also make sure to
include ``RequestHandlerComponent`` in your components. Add the
following to your controller::

    public $components = array('RequestHandler');
    public $helpers = array('Js');

Next link in the JavaScript library you want to use. For this
example we'll be using jQuery::

    echo $this->Html->script('jquery');

Similar to 1.2 you need to tell the ``PaginatorHelper`` that you
want to make JavaScript enhanced links instead of plain HTML ones.
To do so you use ``options()``::
    
    $this->Paginator->options(array(
        'update' => '#content',
        'evalScripts' => true
    ));

The :php:class:`PaginatorHelper` now knows to make JavaScript enhanced
links, and that those links should update the ``#content`` element.
Of course this element must exist, and often times you want to wrap
``$content_for_layout`` with a div matching the id used for the
``update`` option. You also should set ``evalScripts`` to true if
you are using the Mootools or Prototype adapters, without
``evalScripts`` these libraries will not be able to chain requests
together. The ``indicator`` option is not supported by ``JsHelper``
and will be ignored.

You then create all the links as needed for your pagination
features. Since the ``JsHelper`` automatically buffers all
generated script content to reduce the number of ``<script>`` tags
in your source code you **must** write the buffer out. At the
bottom of your view file. Be sure to include::

    echo $this->Js->writeBuffer();

If you omit this you will **not** be able to chain AJAX pagination
links. When you write the buffer, it is also cleared, so you don't
have worry about the same JavaScript being output twice.

Adding effects and transitions
------------------------------

Since ``indicator`` is no longer supported, you must add any
indicator effects yourself:

.. code-block:: php

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <?php echo $this->Html->script('jquery'); ?>
            //more stuff here.
        </head>
        <body>
        <div id="content">
            <?php echo $content_for_layout; ?>
        </div>
        <?php echo $this->Html->image('indicator.gif', array('id' => 'busy-indicator')); ?>
        </body>
    </html>

Remember to place the indicator.gif file inside app/webroot/img
folder. You may see a situation where the indicator.gif displays
immediately upon the page load. You need to put in this CSS
``#busy-indicator { display:none; }`` in your main CSS file.

With the above layout, we've included an indicator image file, that
will display a busy indicator animation that we will show and hide
with the ``JsHelper``. To do that we need to update our
``options()`` function::

    $this->Paginator->options(array(
        'update' => '#content',
        'evalScripts' => true,
        'before' => $this->Js->get('#busy-indicator')->effect('fadeIn', array('buffer' => false)),
        'complete' => $this->Js->get('#busy-indicator')->effect('fadeOut', array('buffer' => false)),
    ));

This will show/hide the busy-indicator element before and after the
``#content`` div is updated. Although ``indicator`` has been
removed, the new features offered by ``JsHelper`` allow for more
control and more complex effects to be created.
