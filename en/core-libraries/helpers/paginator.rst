PaginatorHelper
###############

.. php:class:: PaginatorHelper(View $view, array $settings = array())

The Pagination helper is used to output pagination controls such as
page numbers and next/previous links. It works in tandem with
:php:class:`PaginatorComponent`.

See also :doc:`/core-libraries/components/pagination` for information on how to
create paginated datasets and do paginated queries.

Creating sort links
===================

.. php:method:: sort($key, $title = null, $options = array())

    :param string $key: The name of the key that the recordset should be sorted.
    :param string $title: Title for the link. If $title is null $key will be
        used for the title and will be generated by inflection.
    :param array $options: Options for sorting link.

Generates a sorting link. Sets named or querystring parameters for the sort and
direction. Links will default to sorting by asc. After the first click, links
generated with ``sort()`` will handle direction switching automatically. Link
sorting default by 'asc'. If the resultset is sorted 'asc' by the specified key
the returned link will sort by 'desc'.

Accepted keys for ``$options``:

* ``escape`` Whether you want the contents HTML entity encoded, defaults to
  true.
* ``model`` The model to use, defaults to :php:meth:`PaginatorHelper::defaultModel()`.
* ``direction`` The default direction to use when this link isn't active.
* ``lock`` Lock direction. Will only use the default direction then, defaults to false.

  .. versionadded:: 2.5
    You can now set the lock option to true in order to lock the sorting direction into the
    specified direction.

Assuming you are paginating some posts, and are on page one::

    echo $this->Paginator->sort('user_id');

Output:

.. code-block:: html

    <a href="/posts/index/page:1/sort:user_id/direction:asc/">User Id</a>

You can use the title parameter to create custom text for your link::

    echo $this->Paginator->sort('user_id', 'User account');

Output:

.. code-block:: html

    <a href="/posts/index/page:1/sort:user_id/direction:asc/">User account</a>

If you are using HTML like images in your links remember to set escaping off::

    echo $this->Paginator->sort(
      'user_id',
      '<em>User account</em>',
      array('escape' => false)
    );

Output:

.. code-block:: html

    <a href="/posts/index/page:1/sort:user_id/direction:asc/">
      <em>User account</em>
    </a>

The direction option can be used to set the default direction for a link. Once a
link is active, it will automatically switch directions like normal::

    echo $this->Paginator->sort('user_id', null, array('direction' => 'desc'));

Output:

.. code-block:: html

    <a href="/posts/index/page:1/sort:user_id/direction:desc/">User Id</a>

The lock option can be used to lock sorting into the specified direction::

    echo $this->Paginator->sort('user_id', null, array('direction' => 'asc', 'lock' => true));

.. php:method:: sortDir(string $model = null, mixed $options = array())

    Gets the current direction the recordset is sorted.

.. php:method:: sortKey(string $model = null, mixed $options = array())

    Gets the current key by which the recordset is sorted.

Creating page number links
==========================

.. php:method:: numbers($options = array())

Returns a set of numbers for the paged result set. Uses a modulus to
decide how many numbers to show on each side of the current page  By default
8 links on either side of the current page will be created if those pages exist.
Links will not be generated for pages that do not exist. The current page is
also not a link.

Supported options are:

* ``before`` Content to be inserted before the numbers.
* ``after`` Content to be inserted after the numbers.
* ``model`` Model to create numbers for, defaults to
  :php:meth:`PaginatorHelper::defaultModel()`.
* ``modulus`` how many numbers to include on either side of the current page,
  defaults to 8.
* ``separator`` Separator content defaults to `` | ``
* ``tag`` The tag to wrap links in, defaults to 'span'.
* ``first`` Whether you want first links generated, set to an integer to
  define the number of 'first' links to generate. Defaults to false. If a
  string is set a link to the first page will be generated with the value as the
  title::

      echo $this->Paginator->numbers(array('first' => 'First page'));

* ``last`` Whether you want last links generated, set to an integer to define
  the number of 'last' links to generate. Defaults to false. Follows the same
  logic as the ``first`` option. There is a
  :php:meth:`~PaginatorHelper::last()`` method to be used separately as well if
  you wish.

* ``ellipsis`` Ellipsis content, defaults to '...'
* ``class`` The class name used on the wrapping tag.
* ``currentClass`` The class name to use on the current/active link. Defaults to
  *current*.
* ``currentTag`` Tag to use for current page number, defaults to null.
  This allows you to generate for example Twitter Bootstrap like links with the
  current page number wrapped in extra 'a' or 'span' tag.

While this method allows a lot of customization for its output. It is
also ok to just call the method without any params. ::

    echo $this->Paginator->numbers();

Using the first and last options you can create links to the beginning
and end of the page set. The following would create a set of page links that
include links to the first 2 and last 2 pages in the paged results::

    echo $this->Paginator->numbers(array('first' => 2, 'last' => 2));

.. versionadded:: 2.1
    The ``currentClass`` option was added in 2.1.

.. versionadded:: 2.3
    The ``currentTag`` option was added in 2.3.

Creating jump links
===================

In addition to generating links that go directly to specific page numbers,
you'll often want links that go to the previous and next links, first and last
pages in the paged data set.

.. php:method:: prev($title = '<< Previous', $options = array(), $disabledTitle = null, $disabledOptions = array())

    :param string $title: Title for the link.
    :param mixed $options: Options for pagination link.
    :param string $disabledTitle: Title when the link is disabled, as when
        you're already on the first page, no previous page to go.
    :param mixed $disabledOptions: Options for the disabled pagination link.

    Generates a link to the previous page in a set of paged records.

    ``$options`` and ``$disabledOptions`` supports the following keys:

    * ``tag`` The tag wrapping tag you want to use, defaults to 'span'. Set this to ``false`` to disable this option.
    * ``escape`` Whether you want the contents HTML entity encoded,
      defaults to true.
    * ``model`` The model to use, defaults to :php:meth:`PaginatorHelper::defaultModel()`.
    * ``disabledTag`` Tag to use instead of A tag when there is no previous page

    A simple example would be::

        echo $this->Paginator->prev(
          '<< ' . __('previous'),
          array(),
          null,
          array('class' => 'prev disabled')
        );

    If you were currently on the second page of posts, you would get the
    following:

    .. code-block:: html

        <span class="prev">
          <a rel="prev" href="/posts/index/page:1/sort:title/order:desc">
            &lt;&lt; previous
          </a>
        </span>

    If there were no previous pages you would get:

    .. code-block:: html

        <span class="prev disabled">&lt;&lt; previous</span>

    You can change the wrapping tag using the ``tag`` option::

        echo $this->Paginator->prev(__('previous'), array('tag' => 'li'));

    Output:

    .. code-block:: html

        <li class="prev">
          <a rel="prev" href="/posts/index/page:1/sort:title/order:desc">
            previous
          </a>
        </li>

    You can also disable the wrapping tag::

        echo $this->Paginator->prev(__('previous'), array('tag' => false));

    Output:

    .. code-block:: html

        <a class="prev" rel="prev"
          href="/posts/index/page:1/sort:title/order:desc">
          previous
        </a>

.. versionchanged:: 2.3
    For methods: :php:meth:`PaginatorHelper::prev()` and :php:meth:`PaginatorHelper::next()` it
    is now possible to set the ``tag`` option to ``false`` to disable the
    wrapper. New options ``disabledTag`` has been added.

    If you leave the ``$disabledOptions`` empty the ``$options`` parameter will
    be used. This can save some additional typing if both sets of options are
    the same.

.. php:method:: next($title = 'Next >>', $options = array(), $disabledTitle = null, $disabledOptions = array())

    This method is identical to :php:meth:`~PaginatorHelper::prev()` with a few
    exceptions. It creates links pointing to the next page instead of the
    previous one. It also uses ``next`` as the rel attribute value instead of
    ``prev``

.. php:method:: first($first = '<< first', $options = array())

    Returns a first or set of numbers for the first pages. If a string is given,
    then only a link to the first page with the provided text will be created::

        echo $this->Paginator->first('< first');

    The above creates a single link for the first page. Will output nothing if you
    are on the first page. You can also use an integer to indicate how many first
    paging links you want generated::

        echo $this->Paginator->first(3);

    The above will create links for the first 3 pages, once you get to the third or
    greater page. Prior to that nothing will be output.

    The options parameter accepts the following:

    - ``tag`` The tag wrapping tag you want to use, defaults to 'span'
    - ``after`` Content to insert after the link/tag
    - ``model`` The model to use defaults to :php:meth:`PaginatorHelper::defaultModel()`
    - ``separator`` Content between the generated links, defaults to ' | '
    - ``ellipsis`` Content for ellipsis, defaults to '...'

.. php:method:: last($last = 'last >>', $options = array())

    This method works very much like the :php:meth:`~PaginatorHelper::first()`
    method. It has a few differences though. It will not generate any links if you
    are on the last page for a string values of ``$last``. For an integer value of
    ``$last`` no links will be generated once the user is inside the range of last
    pages.

.. php:method:: current(string $model = null)

    Gets the current page of the recordset for the given model::

        // Our URL is: http://example.com/comments/view/page:3
        echo $this->Paginator->current('Comment');
        // Output is 3

.. php:method:: hasNext(string $model = null)

    Returns true if the given result set is not at the last page.

.. php:method:: hasPrev(string $model = null)

    Returns true if the given result set is not at the first page.

.. php:method:: hasPage(string $model = null, integer $page = 1)

    Returns true if the given result set has the page number given by ``$page``.

Creating a page counter
=======================

.. php:method:: counter($options = array())

Returns a counter string for the paged result set. Using a provided format
string and a number of options you can create localized and application
specific indicators of where a user is in the paged data set.

There are a number of options for ``counter()``. The supported ones are:

* ``format`` Format of the counter. Supported formats are 'range', 'pages'
  and custom. Defaults to pages which would output like '1 of 10'. In the
  custom mode the supplied string is parsed and tokens are replaced with
  actual values. The available tokens are:

  -  ``{:page}`` - the current page displayed.
  -  ``{:pages}`` - total number of pages.
  -  ``{:current}`` - current number of records being shown.
  -  ``{:count}`` - the total number of records in the result set.
  -  ``{:start}`` - number of the first record being displayed.
  -  ``{:end}`` - number of the last record being displayed.
  -  ``{:model}`` - The pluralized human form of the model name.
     If your model was 'RecipePage', ``{:model}`` would be 'recipe pages'.
     This option was added in 2.0.

  You could also supply only a string to the counter method using the tokens
  available. For example::

      echo $this->Paginator->counter(
          'Page {:page} of {:pages}, showing {:current} records out of
           {:count} total, starting on record {:start}, ending on {:end}'
      );

  Setting 'format' to range would output like '1 - 3 of 13'::

      echo $this->Paginator->counter(array(
          'format' => 'range'
      ));

* ``separator`` The separator between the actual page and the number of
  pages. Defaults to ' of '. This is used in conjunction with 'format' =
  'pages' which is 'format' default value::

      echo $this->Paginator->counter(array(
          'separator' => ' of a total of '
      ));

* ``model`` The name of the model being paginated, defaults to
  :php:meth:`PaginatorHelper::defaultModel()`. This is used in
  conjunction with the custom string on 'format' option.

Modifying the options PaginatorHelper uses
==========================================

.. php:method:: options($options = array())

    :param mixed $options: Default options for pagination links. If a
       string is supplied - it is used as the DOM id element to update.

Sets all the options for the Paginator Helper. Supported options are:

* ``url`` The URL of the paginating action. 'url' has a few sub options as well:

  -  ``sort`` The key that the records are sorted by.
  -  ``direction`` The direction of the sorting. Defaults to 'ASC'.
  -  ``page`` The page number to display.

  The above mentioned options can be used to force particular pages/directions.
  You can also append additional URL content into all URLs generated in the
  helper::

      $this->Paginator->options(array(
          'url' => array(
              'sort' => 'email', 'direction' => 'desc', 'page' => 6,
              'lang' => 'en'
          )
      ));

  The above adds the ``en`` route parameter to all links the helper will
  generate. It will also create links with specific sort, direction and page
  values. By default PaginatorHelper will merge in all of the current pass and
  named parameters. So you don't have to do that in each view file.

* ``escape`` Defines if the title field for links should be HTML escaped.
  Defaults to true.

* ``update`` The CSS selector of the element to update with the results of AJAX
  pagination calls. If not specified, regular links will be created::

    $this->Paginator->options(array('update' => '#content'));

  This is useful when doing :ref:`ajax-pagination`. Keep in mind that the value
  of update can be any valid CSS selector, but most often is simpler to use an
  id selector.

* ``model`` The name of the model being paginated, defaults to
  :php:meth:`PaginatorHelper::defaultModel()`.


Using GET parameters for pagination
-----------------------------------

Normally Pagination in CakePHP uses :ref:`named-parameters`. There are times
you want to use GET parameters instead. While the main configuration option for
this feature is in :php:class:`PaginatorComponent`, you have some additional
control in the view. You can use ``options()`` to indicate that you want other
named parameters to be converted::

    $this->Paginator->options(array(
      'convertKeys' => array('your', 'keys', 'here')
    ));

Configuring the PaginatorHelper to use a JavaScript helper
----------------------------------------------------------

By default the ``PaginatorHelper`` uses :php:class:`JsHelper` to do AJAX
features. However, if you don't want that and want to use a custom helper
for AJAX links, you can do so by changing the ``$helpers`` array in your controller.
After running ``paginate()`` do the following::

    // In your controller action.
    $this->set('posts', $this->paginate());
    $this->helpers['Paginator'] = array('ajax' => 'CustomJs');

Will change the ``PaginatorHelper`` to use the ``CustomJs`` for
AJAX operations. You could also set the 'ajax' key to be any
helper, as long as that class implements a ``link()`` method that
behaves like :php:meth:`HtmlHelper::link()`


Pagination in Views
===================

It's up to you to decide how to show records to the user, but most
often this will be done inside HTML tables. The examples below
assume a tabular layout, but the PaginatorHelper available in views
doesn't always need to be restricted as such.

See the details on
`PaginatorHelper <https://api.cakephp.org/2.8/class-PaginatorHelper.html>`_
in the API. As mentioned, the PaginatorHelper also offers sorting features
which can be easily integrated into your table column headers:

.. code-block:: php

    // app/View/Posts/index.ctp
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th><?php echo $this->Paginator->sort('id', 'ID'); ?></th>
            <th><?php echo $this->Paginator->sort('title', 'Title'); ?></th>
        </tr>
           <?php foreach ($data as $recipe): ?>
        <tr>
            <td><?php echo $recipe['Recipe']['id']; ?> </td>
            <td><?php echo h($recipe['Recipe']['title']); ?> </td>
        </tr>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
    </table>

The links output from the ``sort()`` method of the ``PaginatorHelper``
allow users to click on table headers to toggle the sorting of the
data by a given field.

It is also possible to sort a column based on associations:

.. code-block:: html

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th><?php echo $this->Paginator->sort('title', 'Title'); ?></th>
            <th><?php echo $this->Paginator->sort('Author.name', 'Author'); ?></th>
        </tr>
           <?php foreach ($data as $recipe): ?>
        <tr>
            <td><?php echo h($recipe['Recipe']['title']); ?> </td>
            <td><?php echo h($recipe['Author']['name']); ?> </td>
        </tr>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
    </table>

The final ingredient to pagination display in views is the addition
of page navigation, also supplied by the PaginationHelper::

    // Shows the page numbers
    echo $this->Paginator->numbers();

    // Shows the next and previous links
    echo $this->Paginator->prev(
      '« Previous',
      null,
      null,
      array('class' => 'disabled')
    );
    echo $this->Paginator->next(
      'Next »',
      null,
      null,
      array('class' => 'disabled')
    );

    // prints X of Y, where X is current page and Y is number of pages
    echo $this->Paginator->counter();

The wording output by the counter() method can also be customized
using special markers::

    echo $this->Paginator->counter(array(
        'format' => 'Page {:page} of {:pages}, showing {:current} records out of
                 {:count} total, starting on record {:start}, ending on {:end}'
    ));

Other Methods
=============

.. php:method:: link($title, $url = array(), $options = array())

    :param string $title: Title for the link.
    :param mixed $url: Url for the action. See Router::url()
    :param array $options: Options for the link. See options() for list of keys.

    Accepted keys for ``$options``:

    * ``update`` The Id of the DOM element you wish to update. Creates
      AJAX enabled links.
    * ``escape`` Whether you want the contents HTML entity encoded,
      defaults to true.
    * ``model`` The model to use, defaults to
      :php:meth:`PaginatorHelper::defaultModel()`.

    Creates a regular or AJAX link with pagination parameters::

        echo $this->Paginator->link('Sort by title on page 5',
                array('sort' => 'title', 'page' => 5, 'direction' => 'desc'));

    If created in the view for ``/posts/index`` Would create a link
    pointing at '/posts/index/page:5/sort:title/direction:desc'


.. php:method:: url($options = array(), $asArray = false, $model = null)

    :param array $options: Pagination/URL options array. As used on
        ``options()`` or ``link()`` method.
    :param boolean $asArray: Return the URL as an array, or a URI string.
        Defaults to false.
    :param string $model: Which model to paginate on

    By default returns a full pagination URL string for use in non-standard
    contexts (i.e. JavaScript). ::

        echo $this->Paginator->url(array('sort' => 'title'), true);

.. php:method:: defaultModel()

    Gets the default model of the paged sets or null if pagination is not
    initialized.

.. php:method:: params(string $model = null)

    Gets the current paging parameters from the resultset for the given model::

        debug($this->Paginator->params());
        /*
        Array
        (
            [page] => 2
            [current] => 2
            [count] => 43
            [prevPage] => 1
            [nextPage] => 3
            [pageCount] => 3
            [order] =>
            [limit] => 20
            [options] => Array
                (
                    [page] => 2
                    [conditions] => Array
                        (
                        )
                )
            [paramType] => named
        )
        */

.. php:method:: param(string $key, string $model = null)

    Gets the specific paging parameter from the resultset for the given model::

        debug($this->Paginator->param('count'));
        /*
        (int)43
        */

.. versionadded:: 2.4
    The ``param()`` method was added in 2.4.

.. php:method:: meta(array $options = array())

    Outputs the meta-links for a paginated result set::

        echo $this->Paginator->meta(); // Example output for page 5
        /*
        <link href="/?page=4" rel="prev" /><link href="/?page=6" rel="next" />
        */

    You can also append the output of the meta function to the named block::

        $this->Paginator->meta(array('block' => true));

    If true is passed, the "meta" block is used.

.. versionadded:: 2.6
    The ``meta()`` method was added in 2.6.
