4.2 Migration Guide
###################

CakePHP 4.2 is an API compatible upgrade from 4.0. This page outlines the
deprecations and features added in 4.2.

Upgrading to 4.2.0
==================

You can use composer to upgrade to CakePHP 4.2.0::

    php composer.phar require --update-with-dependencies "cakephp/cakephp:4.2.x"

Deprecations
============

4.2 introduces a few deprecations. All of these features will continue for the
duration of 4.x but will be removed in 5.0. You can use the
:ref:`upgrade tool <upgrade-tool-use>` to automate updating usage of deprecated
features::

    bin/cake upgrade rector --rules cakephp42 <path/to/app/src>

.. note::
    This only updates CakePHP 4.2 changes. Make sure you apply CakePHP 4.1 changes first.

A new configuration option has been added to disable deprecations on a path by
path basis. See :ref:`deprecation-warnings` for more information.

Core
----

- ``Exception::responseHeader()`` is now deprecated. Users must use ``HttpException::setHeaders()``
  when setting HTTP response headers. Application and plugin exceptions that set response headers
  should be updated to subclass ``HttpException``.
- ``Cake\Core\Exception\Exception`` was renamed to
  ``Cake\Core\Exception\CakeException``.


Database
--------

- ``Cake\Database\Exception`` was renamed to ``Cake\Database\Exception\DatabaseException``.

ORM
---

- ``TableLocator::allowFallbackClass()`` was added. This method lets you
  disable automatically generated fallback table classes. Disabling is
  currently opt-in, but will become the default in the future.
- ``ORM\Behavior::getTable()`` has been deprecated. Use ``table()`` instead.
  This change makes method names dissimilar between ``ORM\Table`` as the return
  value of these methods is different.


Behavior Changes
================

While the following changes do not change the signature of any methods they do
change the semantics or behavior of methods.

Collection
----------

- ``Collection::groupBy()`` and ``Collection::indexBy()`` now throw an exception when
  the path does not exist or the path contains a null value. Users who need to support
  null should use a callback to return a default value instead.

Controller
----------

- ``Controller::$components`` was marked protected. It was previously documented
  as protected. This should not impact most application code as implementations
  can change the visibility to public.

Component
---------

- ``FlashComponent::set()`` now sets the ``element`` option to ``error`` by
  default when used with an ``Exception`` instance.

Database
--------

- The ``TimeType`` will now correctly marshall values in the ``H:i`` format.
  Previously these values would be cast to ``null`` after validation.
- ``Sqlserver`` driver will retry connect after receiving "Azure Sql Database pausd" errors.

Error
-----

- ``ExceptionRenderer`` now uses the exception code as the HTTP status code
  for ``HttpException`` only. Other exceptions that should return a non-500
  HTTP code are controlled by ``ExceptionRenderer::$exceptionHttpCodes``.

  .. note::
      If you need to restore the previous behavior until your exceptions are updated,
      you can create a custom ExceptionRenderer and override the ``getHttpCode()`` function.
      See :ref:`custom-exceptionrenderer` for more information.

- ``ConsoleErrorHandler`` now uses the exception code as the exit code for
  ``ConsoleException`` only.

Validation
----------

- ``Validation::time()`` will now reject a string if minutes are missing. Previously,
  this would accept hours-only digits although the api documentation showed minutes were required.


Breaking Changes
================

Behind the API, some breaking changes are necessary moving forward.
They usually only affect tests.

I18n
----
- The dependency on [Aura.Intl](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Intl) package has been
  removed as it is no longer maintained. If your app/plugin has :ref:`custom translation loaders <creating-generic-translators>`
  then they need to now return a ``Cake\I18n\Package`` instance instead of ``Aura\Intl\Package``.
  Both the classes are API compatible so you won't need to change anything else.

Testing
-------

- The fixture names around UUIDs have been consolidated (``UuidItemsFixture``, ``BinaryUuidItemsFixture``).
  If you use any of them, make sure you updated these names.
  The ``UuidportfoliosFixture`` was unused in core and removed now.

New Features
============

We're adding a new process to enable us to ship features, collect feedback from
the community and evolve those features. We're calling this process
:ref:`experimental-features`.

Core
----

- Experimental support for a :doc:`/development/dependency-injection` container
  was added.

Console
-------

- ``ConsoleIo::comment()`` was added. This method formats text with a blue
  foreground like comments in the generated help text.
- ``TableHelper`` now supports a ``<text-right>`` formatting tag, which aligns
  cell content with the right edge instead of the left.

Database
--------

- ``SqlServer`` now creates client-side buffered cursors for prepared statements by default.
  This was changed to fix significant performance issues with server-side SCROLL cursors.
  Users should see a performance boost with most results sets.

  .. warning::
      For users with large query results, this may cause an error allocating the client-side buffer unless
      ``Query::disableBufferedResults()`` is called.
      The maximum buffer size can be configured in ``php.ini`` with ``pdo_sqlsrv.client_buffer_max_kb_size``.
      See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/php/cursor-types-pdo-sqlsrv-driver?view=sql-server-ver15#pdo_sqlsrv-and-client-side-cursors
      for more information.
- ``Query::isResultsCastingEnabled()`` was added to get the current result
  casting mode.
- ``StringExpression`` was added to use string literals with collation.
- ``IdentifierExpression`` now supports collation.

Http
----

- ``Cake\Http\Middleware\SessionCsrfProtectionMiddleware`` was added. Instead of
  storing CSRF tokens in a cookie, this middleware stores tokens in the session.
  This makes CSRF tokens user scoped and time based with the session, offering
  enhanced security over cookie based CSRF tokens. This middleware is a drop in
  replacement for the ``CsrfProtectionMiddleware``.
- The ``hal+json``, ``hal+xml``, and ``jsonld`` types were added to
  ``Response`` making them usable with ``withType()``.
- ``Client::createFromUrl()`` was added. This method can be used to create
  HTTP clients scoped to specific domains including a base path.
- A new utility class ``Cake\Http\FlashMessage`` was added whose instance is
  available through ``ServerRequest::getFlash()``. The class similar to the
  ``FlashComponent`` allows you to set flash messages. It can be particularly
  useful for setting flash messages from middlewares.

ORM
---

- ``Table::subquery()`` and  ``Query::subquery()`` were added. These methods
  lets you create query objects that don't have automatic aliasing. This helps
  reduce overhead and complexity of building subqueries and common table
  expressions.
- ``IsUnique`` rule now accepts the ``allowMultipleNulls`` option that was available
  in 3.x. This is disabled by default unlike in 3.x.

TestSuite
---------

- ``EmailTrait::assertMailSubjectContains()`` and
  ``assertMailSubjectContainsAt()`` were added.
- ``mockService()`` was added to ``ConsoleIntegrationTestTrait`` and
  ``IntegrationTestCaseTrait``. This method enables services injected with the
  :doc:`/development/dependency-injection` container to be replaced with mock
  or stub objects.

View
----

- Context classes now include the ``comment``, ``null``, and ``default``
  metadata options in the results of ``attributes()``.
- ``ViewBuilder::addHelper()`` now accepts an ``$options`` parameter to pass
  options into helper constructors.
- The ``assetUrlClassName`` option was added to ``UrlHelper``. This option lets
  you replace the default asset URL resolver with an application specific one.
  This can be useful if you need to customize asset cache busting parameters.
