Migrating from CakePHP 1.2 to 1.3
#################################

This guide summarizes many of the changes necessary when migrating
from a 1.2 to 1.3 Cake core. Each section contains relevant
information for the modifications made to existing methods as well
as any methods that have been removed/renamed.

**App File Replacements (important)**


-  webroot/index.php: Must be replaced due to changes in
   bootstrapping process.
-  config/core.php: Additional settings have been put in place
   which are required for PHP 5.3.
-  webroot/test.php: Replace if you want to run unit tests.

Removed Constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following constants have been removed from CakePHP. If your
application depends on them you must define them in
``app/config/bootstrap.php``


-  ``CIPHER_SEED`` - It has been replaced with Configure class var
   ``Security.cipherSeed`` which should be changed in
   ``app/config/core.php``
-  ``PEAR``
-  ``INFLECTIONS``
-  ``VALID_NOT_EMPTY``
-  ``VALID_EMAIL``
-  ``VALID_NUMBER``
-  ``VALID_YEAR``

Configuration and application bootstrapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bootstrapping Additional Paths.**

In your app/config/bootstrap.php you may have variables like
``$pluginPaths`` or ``$controllerPaths``.
There is a new way to add those paths. As of 1.3 RC1 the
``$pluginPaths`` variables will no longer work. You must use
``App::build()`` to modify paths.

::

    App::build(array(
        'plugins' => array('/full/path/to/plugins/', '/next/full/path/to/plugins/'),
        'models' =>  array('/full/path/to/models/', '/next/full/path/to/models/'),
        'views' => array('/full/path/to/views/', '/next/full/path/to/views/'),
        'controllers' => array('/full/path/to/controllers/', '/next/full/path/to/controllers/'),
        'datasources' => array('/full/path/to/datasources/', '/next/full/path/to/datasources/'),
        'behaviors' => array('/full/path/to/behaviors/', '/next/full/path/to/behaviors/'),
        'components' => array('/full/path/to/components/', '/next/full/path/to/components/'),
        'helpers' => array('/full/path/to/helpers/', '/next/full/path/to/helpers/'),
        'vendors' => array('/full/path/to/vendors/', '/next/full/path/to/vendors/'),
        'shells' => array('/full/path/to/shells/', '/next/full/path/to/shells/'),
        'locales' => array('/full/path/to/locale/', '/next/full/path/to/locale/'),
        'libs' => array('/full/path/to/libs/', '/next/full/path/to/libs/')
    ));

Also changed is the order in which bootstrapping occurs. In the
past ``app/config/core.php`` was loaded **after**
``app/config/bootstrap.php``. This caused any ``App::import()`` in
an application bootstrap to be un-cached and considerably slower
than a cached include. In 1.3 core.php is loaded and the core cache
configs are created **before** bootstrap.php is loaded.

**Loading custom inflections**

``inflections.php`` has been removed, it was an unnecessary file
hit, and the related features have been refactored into a method to
increase their flexibility. You now use ``Inflector::rules()`` to
load custom inflections::

    Inflector::rules('singular', array(
        'rules' => array('/^(bil)er$/i' => '\1', '/^(inflec|contribu)tors$/i' => '\1ta'),
        'uninflected' => array('singulars'),
        'irregular' => array('spins' => 'spinor')
    ));

Will merge the supplied rules into the infection sets, with the
added rules taking precedence over the core rules.

File renames and internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Library Renames**

Core libraries of libs/session.php, libs/socket.php,
libs/model/schema.php and libs/model/behavior.php have been renamed
so that there is a better mapping between filenames and main
classes contained within (as well as dealing with some name-spacing
issues):


-  session.php -> cake\_session.php

   
   -  App::import('Core', 'Session') -> App::import('Core',
      'CakeSession')

-  socket.php -> cake\_socket.php

   
   -  App::import('Core', 'Socket') -> App::import('Core',
      'CakeSocket')

-  schema.php -> cake\_schema.php

   
   -  App::import('Model', 'Schema') -> App::import('Model',
      'CakeSchema')

-  behavior.php -> model\_behavior.php

   
   -  App::import('Core', 'Behavior') -> App::import('Core',
      'ModelBehavior')


In most cases, the above renaming will not affect userland code.

**Inheritance from Object**

The following classes no longer extend Object:


-  Router
-  Set
-  Inflector
-  Cache
-  CacheEngine

If you were using Object methods from these classes, you will need
to not use those methods.

Controller & Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Controller**


-  ``Controller::set()`` no longer changes variables from
   ``$var_name`` to ``$varName``. Variables always appear in the view
   exactly as you set them.

-  ``Controller::set('title', $var)`` no longer sets
   ``$title_for_layout`` when rendering the layout.
   ``$title_for_layout`` is still populated by default. But if you
   want to customize it, use
   ``$this->set('title_for_layout', $var)``.

-  ``Controller::$pageTitle`` has been removed. Use
   ``$this->set('title_for_layout', $var);`` instead.

-  Controller has two new methods ``startupProcess`` and
   ``shutdownProcess``. These methods are responsible for handling the
   controller startup and shutdown processes.

**Component**


-  ``Component::triggerCallback`` has been added. It is a generic
   hook into the component callback process. It supplants
   ``Component::startup()``, ``Component::shutdown()`` and
   ``Component::beforeRender()`` as the preferred way to trigger
   callbacks.

**CookieComponent**


-  ``del`` is deprecated use ``delete``

**AclComponent + DbAcl**

Node reference checks done with paths are now less greedy and will
no longer consume intermediary nodes when doing searches. In the
past given the structure:

::

    ROOT/
        Users/
              Users/
                    edit

The path ``ROOT/Users`` would match the last Users node instead of
the first. In 1.3, if you were expecting to get the last node you
would need to use the path ``ROOT/Users/Users``

**RequestHandlerComponent**


-  ``getReferrer`` is deprecated use ``getReferer``

**SessionComponent & SessionHelper**


-  ``del`` is deprecated use ``delete``

``SessionComponent::setFlash()`` second param used to be used for
setting the layout and accordingly rendered a layout file. This has
been modified to use an element. If you specified custom session
flash layouts in your applications you will need to make the
following changes.


#. Move the required layout files into app/views/elements
#. Rename the $content\_for\_layout variable to $message
#. Make sure you have ``echo $session->flash();`` in your layout

``SessionComponent`` and ``SessionHelper`` are not automatically
loaded.
Both ``SessionComponent`` and ``SessionHelper`` are no longer
automatically included without you asking for them. SessionHelper
and SessionComponent now act like every other component and must be
declared like any other helper/component. You should update
``AppController::$components`` and ``AppController::$helpers`` to
include these classes to retain existing behavior::

    var $components = array('Session', 'Auth', ...);
    var $helpers = array('Session', 'Html', 'Form' ...);

These change were done to make CakePHP more explicit and
declarative in what classes you the application developer want to
use. In the past there was no way to avoid loading the Session
classes without modifying core files. Which is something we want
you to be able to avoid. In addition Session classes were the only
magical component and helper. This change helps unify and normalize
behavior amongst all classes.

Library Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**CakeSession**


-  ``del`` is deprecated use ``delete``

**SessionComponent**


-  ``SessionComponent::setFlash()`` now uses an *element* instead
   of a *layout* as its second parameter. Be sure to move any flash
   layouts from app/views/layouts to app/views/elements and change
   instances of $content\_for\_layout to $message.

**Folder**


-  ``mkdir`` is deprecated use ``create``
-  ``mv`` is deprecated use ``move``
-  ``ls`` is deprecated use ``read``
-  ``cp`` is deprecated use ``copy``
-  ``rm`` is deprecated use ``delete``

**Set**


-  ``isEqual`` is deprecated. Use == or ===.

**String**


-  ``getInstance`` is deprecated, call String methods statically.

**Router**

``Routing.admin`` is deprecated. It provided an inconsistent
behavior with other prefix style routes in that it was treated
differently. Instead you should use ``Routing.prefixes``. Prefix
routes in 1.3 do not require additional routes to be declared
manually. All prefix routes will be generated automatically. To
update simply change your core.php::

    //from:
    Configure::write('Routing.admin', 'admin');
    
    //to:
    Configure::write('Routing.prefixes', array('admin'));

See the New features guide for more information on using prefix
routes. A small change has also been done to routing params. Routed
params should now only consist of alphanumeric chars, - and \_ or
``/[A-Z0-9-_+]+/``::

    Router::connect('/:$%@#param/:action/*', array(...)); // BAD
    Router::connect('/:can/:anybody/:see/:m-3/*', array(...)); //Acceptable

For 1.3 the internals of the Router were heavily refactored to
increase performance and reduce code clutter. The side effect of
this is two seldom used features were removed, as they were
problematic and buggy even with the existing code base. First path
segments using full regular expressions was removed. You can no
longer create routes like::

    Router::connect('/([0-9]+)-p-(.*)/', array('controller' => 'products', 'action' => 'show'));

These routes complicated route compilation and impossible to
reverse route. If you need routes like this, it is recommended that
you use route parameters with capture patterns. Next mid-route
greedy star support has been removed. It was previously possible to
use a greedy star in the middle of a route::

    Router::connect(
        '/pages/*/:event',
        array('controller' => 'pages', 'action' => 'display'), 
        array('event' => '[a-z0-9_-]+')
    );

This is no longer supported as mid-route greedy stars behaved
erratically, and complicated route compiling. Outside of these two
edge-case features and the above changes the router behaves exactly
as it did in 1.2

Also, people using the 'id' key in array-form URLs will notice that
Router::url() now treats this as a named parameter. If you
previously used this approach for passing the ID parameter to
actions, you will need to rewrite all your $html->link() and
$this->redirect() calls to reflect this change.

::

    // old format:
    $url = array('controller' => 'posts', 'action' => 'view', 'id' => $id);
    // use cases:
    Router::url($url);
    $html->link($url);
    $this->redirect($url);
    // 1.2 result:
    /posts/view/123
    // 1.3 result:
    /posts/view/id:123
    // correct format:
    $url = array('controller' => 'posts', 'action' => 'view', $id);

**Dispatcher**

``Dispatcher`` is no longer capable of setting a controller's
layout/viewPath with request parameters. Control of these
properties should be handled by the Controller, not the Dispatcher.
This feature was also undocumented, and untested.

**Debugger**


-  ``Debugger::checkSessionKey()`` has been renamed to
   ``Debugger::checkSecurityKeys()``
-  Calling ``Debugger::output("text")`` no longer works. Use
   ``Debugger::output("txt")``.

**Object**


-  ``Object::$_log`` has been removed. ``CakeLog::write`` is now
   called statically. See :doc:`/core-libraries/logging`
   for more information on changes made to logging.

**Sanitize**


-  ``Sanitize::html()`` now actually always returns escaped
   strings. In the past using the ``$remove`` parameter would skip
   entity encoding, returning possibly dangerous content.
-  ``Sanitize::clean()`` now has a ``remove_html`` option. This
   will trigger the ``strip_tags`` feature of ``Sanitize::html()``,
   and must be used in conjunction with the ``encode`` parameter.

**Configure and App**


-  Configure::listObjects() replaced by App::objects()
-  Configure::corePaths() replaced by App::core()
-  Configure::buildPaths() replaced by App::build()
-  Configure no longer manages paths.
-  Configure::write('modelPaths', array...) replaced by
   App::build(array('models' => array...))
-  Configure::read('modelPaths') replaced by App::path('models')
-  There is no longer a debug = 3. The controller dumps generated
   by this setting often caused memory consumption issues making it an
   impractical and unusable setting. The ``$cakeDebug`` variable has
   also been removed from ``View::renderLayout`` You should remove
   this variable reference to avoid errors.
-  ``Configure::load()`` can now load configuration files from
   plugins. Use ``Configure::load('plugin.file');`` to load
   configuration files from plugins. Any configuration files in your
   application that use ``.`` in the name should be updated to use
   ``_``

**Cache**

In addition to being able to load CacheEngines from app/libs or
plugins, Cache underwent some refactoring for CakePHP1.3. These
refactorings focused around reducing the number and frequency of
method calls. The end result was a significant performance
improvement with only a few minor API changes which are detailed
below.

The changes in Cache removed the singletons used for each Engine
type, and instead an engine instance is made for each unique key
created with ``Cache::config()``. Since engines are not singletons
anymore, ``Cache::engine()`` was not needed and was removed. In
addition ``Cache::isInitialized()`` now checks cache
*configuration names*, not cache *engine names*. You can still use
``Cache::set()`` or ``Cache::engine()`` to modify cache
configurations. Also checkout the
:doc:`/appendices/new-features-in-cakephp-1-3` for
more information on the additional methods added to ``Cache``.

It should be noted that using an app/libs or plugin cache engine
for the default cache config can cause performance issues as the
import that loads these classes will always be uncached. It is
recommended that you either use one of the core cache engines for
your ``default`` configuration, or manually include the cache
engine class before configuring it. Furthermore any non-core cache
engine configurations should be done in
``app/config/bootstrap.php`` for the same reasons detailed above.

Model Databases and Datasources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Model**


-  ``Model::del()`` and ``Model::remove()`` have been removed in
   favor of ``Model::delete()``, which is now the canonical delete
   method.
-  ``Model::findAll``, findCount, findNeighbours, removed.
-  Dynamic calling of setTablePrefix() has been removed.
   tableprefix should be with the ``$tablePrefix`` property, and any
   other custom construction behavior should be done in an overridden
   ``Model::__construct()``.
-  ``DboSource::query()`` now throws warnings for un-handled model
   methods, instead of trying to run them as queries. This means,
   people starting transactions improperly via the
   ``$this->Model->begin()`` syntax will need to update their code so
   that it accesses the model's DataSource object directly.
-  Missing validation methods will now trigger errors in
   development mode.
-  Missing behaviors will now trigger a cakeError.
-  ``Model::find(first)`` will no longer use the id property for
   default conditions if no conditions are supplied and id is not
   empty. Instead no conditions will be used
-  For Model::saveAll() the default value for option 'validate' is
   now 'first' instead of true

**Datasources**


-  DataSource::exists() has been refactored to be more consistent
   with non-database backed datasources. Previously, if you set
   ``var $useTable = false; var $useDbConfig = 'custom';``, it was
   impossible for ``Model::exists()`` to return anything but false.
   This prevented custom datasources from using ``create()`` or
   ``update()`` correctly without some ugly hacks. If you have custom
   datasources that implement ``create()``, ``update()``, and
   ``read()`` (since ``Model::exists()`` will make a call to
   ``Model::find('count')``, which is passed to
   ``DataSource::read()``), make sure to re-run your unit tests on
   1.3.

**Databases**

Most database configurations no longer support the 'connect' key
(which has been deprecated since pre-1.2). Instead, set
``'persistent' => true`` or false to determine whether or not a
persistent database connection should be used

**SQL log dumping**

A commonly asked question is how can one disable or remove the SQL
log dump at the bottom of the page?. In previous versions the HTML
SQL log generation was buried inside DboSource. For 1.3 there is a
new core element called ``sql_dump``. ``DboSource`` no longer
automatically outputs SQL logs. If you want to output SQL logs in
1.3, do the following:

::

    echo $this->element('sql_dump');

You can place this element anywhere in your layout or view. The
``sql_dump`` element will only generate output when
``Configure::read('debug')`` is equal to 2. You can of course
customize or override this element in your app by creating
``app/views/elements/sql_dump.ctp``.

View and Helpers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**View**


-  ``View::renderElement`` removed. Use ``View::element()``
   instead.
-  Automagic support for ``.thtml`` view file extension has been
   removed either declare ``$this->ext = 'thtml';`` in your
   controllers, or rename your views to use ``.ctp``
-  ``View::set('title', $var)`` no longer sets
   ``$title_for_layout`` when rendering the layout.
   ``$title_for_layout`` is still populated by default. But if you
   want to customize it, use ``$this->set('title_for_layout', $var)``.
-  ``View::$pageTitle`` has been removed. Use
   ``$this->set('title_for_layout', $var);`` instead.
-  The ``$cakeDebug`` layout variable associated with debug = 3 has
   been removed. Remove it from your layouts as it will cause errors.
   Also see the notes related to SQL log dumping and Configure for
   more information.

All core helpers no longer use ``Helper::output()``. The method was
inconsistently used and caused output issues with many of
FormHelper's methods. If you previously overrode
``AppHelper::output()`` to force helpers to auto-echo you will need
to update your view files to manually echo helper output.

**TextHelper**


-  ``TextHelper::trim()`` is deprecated, used ``truncate()``
   instead.
-  ``TextHelper::highlight()`` no longer has:
-  an ``$highlighter`` parameter. Use ``$options['format']``
   instead.
-  an ``$considerHtml``parameter. Use ``$options['html']`` instead.
-  ``TextHelper::truncate()`` no longer has:
-  an ``$ending`` parameter. Use ``$options['ending']`` instead.
-  an ``$exact`` parameter. Use ``$options['exact']`` instead.
-  an ``$considerHtml``parameter. Use ``$options['html']``
   instead.

**PaginatorHelper**

PaginatorHelper has had a number of enhancements applied to make
styling easier.
``prev()``, ``next()``, ``first()`` and ``last()``

The disabled state of these methods now defaults to ``<span>`` tags
instead of ``<div>`` tags.

passedArgs are now auto merged with url options in paginator.

``sort()``, ``prev()``, ``next()`` now add additional class names
to the generated html. ``prev()`` adds a class of prev. ``next()``
adds a class of next. ``sort()`` will add the direction currently
being sorted, either asc or desc.

**FormHelper**


-  ``FormHelper::dateTime()`` no longer has a ``$showEmpty``
   parameter. Use ``$attributes['empty']`` instead.
-  ``FormHelper::year()`` no longer has a ``$showEmpty`` parameter.
   Use ``$attributes['empty']`` instead.
-  ``FormHelper::month()`` no longer has a ``$showEmpty``
   parameter. Use ``$attributes['empty']`` instead.
-  ``FormHelper::day()`` no longer has a ``$showEmpty`` parameter.
   Use ``$attributes['empty']`` instead.
-  ``FormHelper::minute()`` no longer has a ``$showEmpty``
   parameter. Use ``$attributes['empty']`` instead.
-  ``FormHelper::meridian()`` no longer has a ``$showEmpty``
   parameter. Use ``$attributes['empty']`` instead.
-  ``FormHelper::select()`` no longer has a ``$showEmpty``
   parameter. Use ``$attributes['empty']`` instead.
-  Default URLs generated by form helper no longer contain 'id'
   parameter. This makes default URLs more consistent with documented
   userland routes. Also enables reverse routing to work in a more
   intuitive fashion with default FormHelper URLs.
-  ``FormHelper::submit()`` Can now create other types of inputs
   other than type=submit. Use the type option to control the type of
   input generated.
-  ``FormHelper::button()`` Now creates ``<button>`` elements
   instead of reset or clear inputs. If you want to generate those
   types of inputs use ``FormHelper::submit()`` with a
   ``'type' => 'reset'`` option for example.
-  ``FormHelper::secure()`` and ``FormHelper::create()`` no longer
   create hidden fieldset elements. Instead they create hidden div
   elements. This improves validation with HTML4.

Also be sure to check the :ref:`form-improvements-1-3` for additional changes and 
new features in the FormHelper.

**HtmlHelper**


-  ``HtmlHelper::meta()`` no longer has an ``$inline`` parameter.
   It has been merged with the ``$options`` array.
-  ``HtmlHelper::link()`` no longer has an ``$escapeTitle``
   parameter. Use ``$options['escape']`` instead. The ``escape`` option
   now controls the escaping of the title and attributes at the same time.
-  ``HtmlHelper::para()`` no longer has an ``$escape`` parameter.
   Use ``$options['escape']`` instead.
-  ``HtmlHelper::div()`` no longer has an ``$escape`` parameter.
   Use ``$options['escape']`` instead.
-  ``HtmlHelper::tag()`` no longer has an ``$escape`` parameter.
   Use ``$options['escape']`` instead.
-  ``HtmlHelper::css()`` no longer has an ``$inline`` parameter.
   Use ``$options['inline']`` instead.

**SessionHelper**


-  ``flash()`` no longer auto echos. You must add an
   ``echo $session->flash();`` to your session->flash() calls. ``flash()``
   was the only helper method that auto outputted, and was changed to
   create consistency in helper methods.

**CacheHelper**

CacheHelper's interactions with ``Controller::$cacheAction`` has
changed slightly. In the past if you used an array for
``$cacheAction`` you were required to use the routed url as the
keys, this caused caching to break whenever routes were changed.
You also could set different cache durations for different passed
argument values, but not different named parameters or query string
parameters. Both of these limitations/inconsistencies have been
removed. You now use the controller's action names as the keys for
``$cacheAction``. This makes configuring ``$cacheAction`` easier as
it's no longer coupled to the routing, and allows cacheAction to
work with all custom routing. If you need to have custom cache
durations for specific argument sets you will need to detect and
update cacheAction in your controller.

**TimeHelper**

TimeHelper has been refactored to make it more i18n friendly.
Internally almost all calls to date() have been replaced by
strftime(). The new method TimeHelper::i18nFormat() has been added
and will take localization data from a LC\_TIME locale definition
file in app/locale following the POSIX standard. These are the
changes made in the TimeHelper API:


-  TimeHelper::format() can now take a time string as first
   parameter and a format string as the second one, the format must be
   using the strftime() style. When called with this parameter order
   it will try to automatically convert the date format into the
   preferred one for the current locale. It will also take parameters
   as in 1.2.x version to be backwards compatible, but in this case
   format string must be compatible with date().
-  TimeHelper::i18nFormat() has been added

**Deprecated Helpers**

Both the JavascriptHelper and the AjaxHelper are deprecated, and
the JsHelper + HtmlHelper should be used in their place.

You should replace


-  ``$javascript->link()`` with ``$html->script()``
-  ``$javascript->codeBlock()`` with ``$html->scriptBlock()`` or
   ``$html->scriptStart()`` and ``$html->scriptEnd()`` depending on
   your usage.

Console and shells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Shell**

``Shell::getAdmin()`` has been moved up to
``ProjectTask::getAdmin()``

**Schema shell**


-  ``cake schema run create`` has been renamed to
   ``cake schema create``
-  ``cake schema run update`` has been renamed to
   ``cake schema update``

**Console Error Handling**

The shell dispatcher has been modified to exit with a ``1`` status
code if the method called on the shell explicitly returns
``false``. Returning anything else results in a ``0`` status code.
Before the value returned from the method was used directly as the
status code for exiting the shell.

Shell methods which are returning ``1`` to indicate an error should
be updated to return ``false`` instead.

``Shell::error()`` has been modified to exit with status code 1
after printing the error message which now uses a slightly
different formatting.

::

    $this->error('Invalid Foo', 'Please provide bar.');
    // outputs:
    Error: Invalid Foo
    Please provide bar.
    // exits with status code 1

``ShellDispatcher::stderr()`` has been modified to not prepend
Error: to the message anymore. Its signature is now similar to
``Shell::stdout()``.

**ShellDispatcher::shiftArgs()**

The method has been modified to return the shifted argument. Before
if no arguments were available the method was returning false, it
now returns null. Before if arguments were available the method was
returning true, it now returns the shifted argument instead.

Vendors, Test Suite & schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**vendors/css, vendors/js, and vendors/img**

Support for these three directories, both in ``app/vendors`` as
well as ``plugin/vendors`` has been removed. They have been
replaced with plugin and theme webroot directories.

**Test Suite and Unit Tests**

Group tests should now extend TestSuite instead of the deprecated
GroupTest class. If your Group tests do not run, you will need to
update the base class.

**Vendor, plugin and theme assets**

Vendor asset serving has been removed in 1.3 in favour of plugin
and theme webroot directories.

Schema files used with the SchemaShell have been moved to
``app/config/schema`` instead of ``app/config/sql`` Although
``config/sql`` will continue to work in 1.3, it will not in future
versions, it is recommend that the new path is used.
