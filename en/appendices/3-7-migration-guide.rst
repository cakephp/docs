Soft Deprecations
=================

The following methods, properties and features have been deprecated but will not
be removed until 5.0.0:

* ``Cake\TestSuite\ConsoleIntegrationTestCase`` is deprecated. You should
  include ``Cake\TestSuite\ConsoleIntegrationTestTrait`` into your test case
  class instead.

Behavior Changes
================

* ``Cake\Database\Type\IntegerType`` will now raise an exception when values
  are not numeric when preparing SQL statements and coverting database results
  to PHP types.
* ``Cake\Database\Statement\StatementDecorator::fetchAll()`` now returns an
  empty array instead of ``false`` when no result is found.
* ``Cake\Database\Statement\BufferedStatement`` no longer inherits from
  ``StatementDecorator`` and no longer implements the ``IteratorAggregate``
  interface. Instead it directly implements the ``Iterator`` interface to better
  support using statements with collections.
* When marshalling data from the request into entities, the ORM will now convert
  non-scalar data into ``null`` for boolean, integer, float, and decimal types.
* ``ExceptionRenderer`` will now **always** call handler methods for custom
  application exception classes. Previously, custom exception class handler
  methods would only be invoked in debug mode.
* ``Router::url()`` will now default the ``_method`` key to ``GET`` when
  generating URLs with ``Router::url()``.


New Features
============

Cache
-----

* The ``ArrayEngine`` was added. This engine provides an ephemeral in memory
  cache implementation. It is ideal for test suites or long running processes
  where you don't want persistent cache storage.

Database
--------

* ``Cake\Database\FunctionsBuilder::rand()`` was added.

Datasource
----------

* ``Paginator`` will now match unprefixed ``sort`` values in the query string to
  the primary model if there also exists a matching model prefixed default sort
  field. As an example, if your controller defines a default sort of
  ``['Users.name' => 'desc']`` you can now use either ``Users.name`` or ``name``
  as your sort key.

Error
-----

* ``ExceptionRenderer`` will now look for prefixed error controllers when
  handling exceptions. This allows you to define custom error controller logic
  for each routing prefix in your application.
* ``ErrorHandlerMiddleware`` will now include previous exceptions in logging.

Filesystem
----------

* ``Cake\Filesystem\Folder::normalizeFullPath()`` was added.

Form
----

* ``Cake\Form\Form::setData()`` was added. This method makes defining default
  values for forms simpler.
* ``Cake\Form\Form::getData()`` was added.

Http
----

* ``Cake\Http\ServerRequest::setTrustedProxies()`` was added.
* ``Cake\Http\Client`` will now default to use a Curl based adapter if the
  ``curl`` extension is installed.
* New constants have been added to the ``SecurityHeadersMiddleware``. The new
  constants are used to build the components of HTTP headers.

Mailer
------

* ``Cake\Email\TransportFactory`` and ``Cake\Email\TransportRegistry`` were
  added. This class extracts transport creation out of Email, allowing Email to
  become simpler in the future.

ORM
---

* ``Cake\ORM\EntityTrait::hasErrors()`` was added. This method can be used to
  check whether or not an entity has errors more efficiently than
  ``getErrors()`` does.
* Updating has many association data now respects ``_ids``. This makes patching
  has many associations work the same as creating new entities, and creates
  consistency with belongs to many associations.

Shell
-----

* ``cake i18n extract`` has a new ``--relative-paths`` option that makes path
  comments in POT files relative to the application root directory instead of
  absolute paths.
* ``cake i18n extract`` has a new ``--marker-error`` option that enables
  reporting of translation functions that use non-static values as comments in
  POT files.



TestSuite
---------

* New assertion methods were added to ``IntegrationTestCase``:

  * ``assertResponseNotEquals()``,
  * ``assertHeaderNotContains()``
  * ``assertRedirectNotContains()``
  * ``assertFlashElement()``
  * ``assertFlashElementAt()``

* The custom assertions provided by ``IntegrationTestCase`` and
  ``ConsoleIntegrationTestCase`` are now implemented through constraint classes.
* ``TestCase::loadPlugins()``, ``removePlugins()`` and ``clearPlugins()`` were
  added to make working with dynamically loaded plugins easier now that
  ``Plugin::load()`` and ``Plugin::unload()`` are deprecated.
* ``getMockForModel()`` now supports ``null`` for the ``$methods`` parameter.
  This allows you to create mocks that still execute the original code. This
  aligns the behavior with how PHPUnit mock objects work.
* Added ``EmailTrait`` to help facilitate testing emails.


Utility
-------

* ``Cake\Utility\Text::getTransliterator()`` was added.
* ``Cake\Utility\Text::setTransliterator()`` was added.
* ``Cake\Utility\Xml::loadHtml()`` was added.

Validation
----------

* ``Cake\Validation\Validation::iban()`` was added for validating international
  bank account numbers.
* ``Cake\Validation\Validator::allowEmptyString()``, ``allowEmptyArray()``,
  ``allowEmptyDate()``, ``allowEmptyTime()``, ``allowEmptyDateTime()``, and
  ``allowEmptyFile()`` were added. These new methods replace ``allowEmpty()``
  and give you more control over what a field should consider empty.

View
----

* ``FormHelper`` now supports a ``confirmJs`` template variable which allows the
  javascript snippet generated for confirmation boxes to be customized.
* ``FormHelper`` now has a ``autoSetCustomValidity`` option for setting HTML5
  validity messages from custom validation messages. See: :ref:`html5-validity-messages`
* ``ViewBuilder`` had ``setVar()``, ``setVars()``, ``getVar()``, ``getVars()`` and
  ``hasVar()`` added. These methods will replace the public ``viewVars``
  property defined in ``ViewVarsTrait``.
* ``PaginatorHelper`` will now match unprefixed sort keys to model prefixed ones
  on the default model. This allow smooth operation with the changes made in
  ``Cake\Datasource\Paginator``
