3.9 Migration Guide
###################

CakePHP 3.9 is an API compatible upgrade from 3.8. This page outlines the
changes and improvements made.

To upgrade to 3.9.x run the following composer command:

.. code-block:: bash

    php composer.phar require --update-with-dependencies "cakephp/cakephp:3.9.*"

Deprecations
============

* ``ConsoleIo::info()``, ``success()``,  ``warning()`` and ``error()`` will no
  longer accept ``null`` values in the ``message`` parameter in 4.0.
* Using a comma separated string for ``$fixtures`` in test cases is deprecated.
  Instead use an array, or implement the new ``getFixtures()`` method on your
  test case classes.
* ``Validator::errors()`` was renamed to ``Validator::validate()``.
* ``FormHelper::create()`` now emits deprecation warnings when the ``$context``
  parameter is a boolean or string. These values trigger fatal errors in 4.0 and
  will need to be updated before upgrading.
* The magic method signature for ``FunctionBuilder::cast([...])`` is deprecated.
  Use ``FunctionBuilder::cast('field', 'type')`` instead.
* Abandoned ``zendframework`` package has been replaced with `laminas <https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros>`_
  which provides backwards-compatible classes.

New Features
============

Cache
-----

* ``MemcachedEngine::write()`` and ``add()`` no longer cap duration to 30 days.
  Instead all expiration values are forwarded to memcache.

Console
-------

* ``ConsoleIo::abort()`` was added.
* Command classes can implement the ``defaultName()`` method to overwrite the
  conventions based CLI name.

Database
--------

* ``Driver::newTableSchema()`` was added. This hook method lets you customize
  which the class used for schema metadata.
* ``FunctionBuilder::cast()`` was added.
* ``Query::orderAsc()`` and ``Query::orderDesc()`` now accept Closure's as their
  field enabling you to use build complex order expressions with the provided
  ``QueryExpression`` object.

Datasource
----------

* ``Cake\Datasource\SimplePaginator`` was added. This class makes paginating
  very large results more efficient. It skips running the potentially expensive
  ``count()`` query. If you only use 'next' and 'previous' navigation in
  your pagination controls this class can be a good solution.

Http
----

* ``Cake\Http\Client\Response::isSuccess()`` was backported from 4.0
* ``Cake\Http\Middleware\CspMiddleware`` was backported from 4.0
* ``BaseApplication::addOptionalPlugin()`` was added. This method handles
  loading plugins, and handling errors for plugins that may not exist because
  they are dev dependencies.

I18n
----

* ``Number::FORMAT_CURRENCY_ACCOUNTING`` was added.
* ``Number::CURRENCY_ACCOUNTING`` was added.
* ``Number::getDefaultCurrencyFormat()`` and
  ``Number::setDefaultCurrencyFormat()`` were added. These methods let you
  define the formatting style for currency values.
* The ``setJsonEncodeFormat`` method on  ``Time``, ``FrozenTime``, ``Date`` and
  ``FrozenDate`` now accepts a callable that can be used to return a custom
  string.
* The i18n global functions now only return strings. The changes made to 4.0 to
  remove the null return value when no translation string is provide have been
  backported to 3.9.

ORM
---

* ``Table::saveManyOrFail()`` method has been added that will throw ``PersistenceFailedException``
  with the specific entity that failed in case of an error. The entities are saved within a transaction.
* ``Table::deleteMany()`` and ``Table::deleteManyOrFail()`` methods have been added for removing many
  entities at once including callbacks. The entities are removed within a transaction.
* ``TableLocator::clear()`` now resets the internal ``options`` array.
* BelongsToMany associations now respect the bindingKey set in the junction table's BelongsTo association.
  Previously, the target table's primary key was always used instead.
* ``Query::clearResult()`` was added. This method lets you remove the result
  from a query so you can re-execute it.

TestSuite
---------

* ``TestCase::getFixtures()`` was added. This method lets you generate your
  fixture list using application specific logic if necessary.
* ``TestSuite\EmailTrait::assertMailContainsAttachment()`` was added.

Utility
-------

* ``Hash::combine()`` now accepts ``null`` for the ``$keyPath`` parameter.
  Providing null will result in a numerically indexed output array.
* ``Hash::sort()`` now accepts the ``SORT_ASC`` and ``SORT_DESC`` constants in the direction parameter.
* ``Text::uuid`` now uses ``random_int()`` with PHP 5.6 insted of ``mt_rand()``.
  This adds a dependency on paragonie/random_compat which implements it for PHP 5.6.

Validation
----------

* The 'empty' field detection in ``Validator`` now considers
  ``UploadedFileInterface`` objects that have ``UPLOAD_ERR_NO_FILE`` as their
  error code to be empty.
* ``Validation::notAlphaNumeric()`` and ``Validator::notAlphaNumeric()`` were
  backported from 4.x.
* ``Validation::asciiAlphaNumeric()`` and ``Validator::asciiAlphaNumeric()``
  were backported from 4.x.
* ``Validation::notAsciiAlphaNumeric()`` and
  ``Validator::notAsciiAlphaNumeric()`` were backported from 4.x.

View
----

* ``FormHelper`` had the ``selectedClass`` template variable added. This template
  key controls the class name used when a radio or checkbox is selected.
