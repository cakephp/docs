4.0 Upgrade Guide
#################

First, check that your application is running on latest CakePHP 3.x version.

.. note::
    The upgrade tool only works on applications running on latest CakePHP 3.x. You cannot run the upgrade tool after updating to CakePHP 4.0.

Fix Deprecation Warnings
========================

Once your application is running on latest CakePHP 3.x, enable deprecation warnings in **config/app.php**::

    'Error' => [
        'errorLevel' => E_ALL,
    ]

Now that you can see all the warnings, make sure these are fixed before proceding with the upgrade.

Upgrade to PHP 7.2
==================

If you are not running on **PHP 7.2 or higher**, you will need to upgrade PHP before updating CakePHP.

.. note::
    CakePHP 4.0 requires **a minimum of PHP 7.2**.

Use the Upgrade Tool
====================

Because CakePHP 4 adopts strict mode and uses more typehinting, there are many
backwards incompatible changes concerning method signatures and file renames.
To help expedite fixing these tedious changes there is an upgrade CLI tool:

.. warning::
    The ``file_rename`` command and rector rules for cakephp40, and phpunit80
    are intended to be run **before** you update your application's dependencies
    to 4.0. The ``cakephp40`` rector rules will not run correctly if your
    application already has its dependencies updated to 4.x or PHPUnit8.

.. code-block:: console

    # Install the upgrade tool
    git clone git://github.com/cakephp/upgrade
    cd upgrade
    git checkout master
    composer install --no-dev

With the upgrade tool installed you can now run it on your application or
plugin:

.. code-block:: console

    # Rename locale files
    bin/cake upgrade file_rename locales <path/to/app>

    # Rename template files
    bin/cake upgrade file_rename templates <path/to/app>

Once you've renamed your template and locale files, make sure you update
``App.paths.locales`` and ``App.paths.templates`` paths in **/config/app.php**. If needed, refer to the `skeleton app config <https://github.com/cakephp/app/blob/4.x/config/app.php>`_.

Applying Rector Refactorings
----------------------------

Next use the ``rector`` command to automatically fix many deprecated CakePHP and
PHPUnit method calls. It is important to apply rector **before** you upgrade
your dependencies::

    bin/cake upgrade rector --rules phpunit80 <path/to/app/tests>
    bin/cake upgrade rector --rules cakephp40 <path/to/app/src>

You can also use the upgrade tool to apply new rector rules for each minor
version of CakePHP::

    # Run the rector rules for the 4.0 -> 4.1 upgrade.
    bin/cake upgrade rector --rules cakephp41 <path/to/app/src>

Update CakePHP Dependency
=========================

After applying rector refactorings, upgrade CakePHP and PHPUnit with the following
composer commands:

.. code-block:: console

    php composer.phar require --dev --update-with-dependencies "phpunit/phpunit:^8.0"
    php composer.phar require --update-with-dependencies "cakephp/cakephp:4.0.*"

Application.php
===============

Next, ensure your ``src/Application.php`` has been updated to have the same
method signatures as the one found in cakephp/app. You can find the current
`Application.php
<https://github.com/cakephp/app/blob/master/src/Application.php>`__ on GitHub.

If you are providing some kind of REST API, don't forget to include the
:ref:`body-parser-middleware`. Finally, you should consider upgrading to the new
`AuthenticationMiddleware </authentication/2/en/index.html>`__
and `AuthorizationMiddleware </authorization/2/en/index.html>`__, if you are still
using ``AuthComponent``.
