3.3 Migration Guide
###################

CakePHP 3.3 is an API compatible upgrade from 3.2. This page outlines the
changes and improvements made in 3.3.

Deprecations
============

* ``Router::mapResources()`` is deprecated. Use routing scopes and
  ``$routes->resources()`` instead.
* ``Router::redirect()`` is deprecated. Use routing scopes and
  ``$routes->redirect()`` instead.
* ``Router::parseNamedParams()`` is deprecated. Named parameter backwards
  compatibility will be removed in 4.0.0
* ``Cake\Http\Response`` has had the following methods deprecated because they
  overlap with PSR7 interface methods:

  * ``statusCode()`` use ``getStatusCode()`` instead.
  * ``encoding()`` use ``getEncoding()`` instead.
  * ``header()`` use ``getHeaderLine()`` instead.
  * ``cookie()`` use ``getCookie()`` instead.
  * ``version()`` use ``getProtocolVersion()`` instead.
* Dispatcher Filters are now deprecated. Use :doc:`/controllers/middleware`
  instead.

Behavior Changes
================

While these changes are API compatible, they represent minor variances in
behavior that may effect your application:

* The default JSON encode format for Date and DateTime instances is now
  ISO-8601. This means that the timezone value contains a ``:``.
  For example ``2015-11-06T00:00:00+03:00``
* ``Controller::referer()`` now consistently omits the application base path
  when generating application local URLs. Previously string URLs would have the
  base path prepended to them, while array URLs would not.

PSR7 Middleware Support Added
=============================

In tandem with the deprecation of Dispatcher Filters, support for PSR7
middleware has been added. Middleware is part of the new HTTP stack that is an
opt-in component of CakePHP 3.3.0. By using the new HTTP stack, you can take
advantage of features like:

* Using middleware from plugins, and libraries outside of CakePHP.
* Leverage the same response object methods in both the responses you get from
  ``Http\Client`` and the responses your application generates.
* Be able to augment the response objects emitted by error handling and asset
  delivery.

See the :doc:`/controllers/middleware` chapter and :ref:`adding-http-stack`
sections for more information and how to add the new HTTP stack to an existing
application.

Http Client is now PSR7 Compatible
==================================

``Cake\Network\Http\Client`` has been moved to ``Cake\Http\Client``. Its request
and response objects now implement the
`PSR7 interfaces <http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/>`__. Several methods on
``Cake\Http\Client\Response`` are now deprecated, see above for more
information.

ORM Improvements
================

* Additional support has been added for mapping complex data types. This makes
  it easier to work with geo-spatial types, and data that cannot be represented
  by strings in SQL queries. See the
  :ref:`mapping-custom-datatypes-to-sql-expressions` for more information.
* A new ``JsonType`` was added. This new type lets you use the native JSON types
  available in MySQL and Postgres. In other database providers the ``json`` type
  will map to ``TEXT`` columns.
* ``Association::unique()`` was added. This method proxies the target table's
  ``unique()`` method, but ensures that association conditions are applied.
* ``isUnique`` rules now apply association conditions.
* When entities are converted into JSON, the associated objects are no longer
  converted to an array first using ``toArray()``. Instead, the
  ``jsonSerialize()`` method will be invoked on all associated entities. This
  gives you more flexibility and control on which properties are exposed in JSON
  representations of your entities.
* ``Table::newEntity()`` and ``Table::patchEntity()`` will now raise an
  exception when an unknown association is in the 'associated' key.
* ``RulesChecker::validCount()`` was added. This new method allows to apply
  rules to the number of associated records an entity has.
* The ``partialNullsPass`` option was added to the ``existsIn`` rule. This
  option allows rules to pass when some columns are null.

Multiple Pagination Support Added
=================================

You can now paginate multiple queries in a single controller action/view
template. See the :ref:`paginating-multiple-queries` section for more
details.

Cache Shell Added
=================

To help you better manage cached data from the CLI environment, a shell command
has been added that exposes methods for clearing cached data::

    // Clear one cache config
    bin/cake cache clear <configname>

    // Clear all cache configs
    bin/cake cache clear_all

FormHelper
==========

* FormHelper will now automatically set the default value of fields to the
  default value defined in your database columns. You can disable this behavior
  by setting ``schemaDefault`` option to false.

Validation
==========

* ``Validator::requirePresence()`` now accepts a list of fields. This allows you
  to more concisely define the fields that are required.
* ``Validator::requirePresence()``, ``Validator::allowEmpty()`` and
  ``Validator::notEmpty()`` now accept a list of fields. This allows you
  to more concisely define the fields that are required.


Other Enhancements
==================

* ``Collection::transpose()`` was added. This method allows you to tranpose the
  rows and columns of a matrix with equal length rows.

Routing
-------

* ``Router::parse()``, ``RouteCollection::parse()`` and ``Route::parse()`` had
  a ``$method`` argument added. It defaults to 'GET'. This new parameter reduces
  reliance on global state, and necessary for the PSR7 work integration to be
  done.
* When building resource routes, you can now define a prefix. This is useful
  when defining nested resources as you can create specialized controllers for
  nested resources.
* Dispatcher Filters are now deprecated. Use :doc:`/controllers/middleware`
  instead.

Console
-------

* Shell tasks that are invoked directly from the CLI no longer have their
  ``_welcome`` method invoked. They will also have the ``requested`` parameter
  set now.
* ``Shell::err()`` will now apply the 'error' style to text. The default
  styling is red text.

Request
-------

* ``Request::is()`` and ``Request::addDetector()`` now supports additional
  arguments in detectors. This allows detector callables to operate on
  additional parameters.

Debugging Functions
-------------------

* The ``pr()``, ``debug()``, and ``pj()`` functions now return the value being
  dumped. This makes them easier to use when values are being returned.
