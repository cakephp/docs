Behaviors
#########

Behaviors are a way to organize and enable horizontal re-use of Model layer
logic. Conceptually they are similar to traits. However, behaviors are
implemented as separate classes. This allows them to hook into the
life-cycle callbacks that models emit, while providing trait-like features.

Behaviors provide a convenient way to package up behavior that is common across
many models. For example, CakePHP includes a ``TimestampBehavior``. Many
models will want timestamp fields, and the logic to manage these fields is
not specific to any one model. It is these kinds of scenarios that behaviors are
a perfect fit for.

Creating a Behavior
===================

In the following examples we will create a very simple ``SluggableBehavior``.
This behavior will allow us to populate a slug field with the results of
``Inflector::slug()`` based on another field.

Before we create our behavior we should understand the conventions for
behaviors:

- Behavior files are located in **src/Model/Behavior**, or
  ``MyPlugin\Model\Behavior``.
- Behavior classes should be in the ``App\Model\Behavior`` namespace, or
  ``MyPlugin\Model\Behavior`` namespace.
- Behavior class names end in ``Behavior``.
- Behaviors extend ``Cake\ORM\Behavior``.

To create our sluggable behavior. Put the following into
**src/Model/Behavior/SluggableBehavior.php**::

    namespace App\Model\Behavior;

    use Cake\ORM\Behavior;

    class SluggableBehavior extends Behavior
    {
    }

Similar to tables, behaviors also have an ``initialize()`` hook where you can
put your behavior's initialization code, if required::

    public function initialize(array $config)
    {
        // Some initialization code here
    }


We can now add this behavior to one of our table classes. In this example we'll
use an ``ArticlesTable``, as articles often have slug properties for creating
friendly URLs::

    namespace App\Model\Table;

    use Cake\ORM\Table;

    class ArticlesTable extends Table
    {

        public function initialize(array $config)
        {
            $this->addBehavior('Sluggable');
        }
    }

Our new behavior doesn't do much of anything right now. Next, we'll add a mixin
method and an event listener so that when we save entities we can automatically
slug a field.

Defining Mixin Methods
----------------------

Any public method defined on a behavior will be added as a 'mixin' method on the
table object it is attached to. If you attach two behaviors that provide the
same methods an exception will be raised. If a behavior provides the same method
as a table class, the behavior method will not be callable from the table.
Behavior mixin methods will receive the exact same arguments that are provided
to the table. For example, if our SluggableBehavior defined the following
method::

    public function slug($value)
    {
        return Inflector::slug($value, $this->_config['replacement']);
    }

It could be invoked using::

    $slug = $articles->slug('My article name');

Limiting or Renaming Exposed Mixin Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating behaviors, there may be situations where you don't want to expose
public methods as mixin methods. In these cases you can use the
``implementedMethods`` configuration key to rename or exclude mixin methods. For
example if we wanted to prefix our slug() method we could do the following::

    protected $_defaultConfig = [
        'implementedMethods' => [
            'superSlug' => 'slug',
        ]
    ];

Applying this configuration will make ``slug()`` not callable, however it will
add a ``superSlug()`` mixin method to the table. Notably if our behavior
implemented other public methods they would **not** be available as mixin
methods with the above configuration.

Since the exposed methods are decided by configuration you can also
rename/remove mixin methods when adding a behavior to a table. For example::

    // In a table's initialize() method.
    $this->addBehavior('Sluggable', [
        'implementedMethods' => [
            'superSlug' => 'slug',
        ]
    ]);

Defining Event Listeners
------------------------

Now that our behavior has a mixin method to slug fields, we can implement
a callback listener to automatically slug a field when entities are saved. We'll
also modify our slug method to accept an entity instead of just a plain value. Our
behavior should now look like::

    namespace App\Model\Behavior;

    use Cake\Datasource\EntityInterface;
    use Cake\Event\Event;
    use Cake\ORM\Behavior;
    use Cake\ORM\Entity;
    use Cake\ORM\Query;
    use Cake\Utility\Inflector;

    class SluggableBehavior extends Behavior
    {
        protected $_defaultConfig = [
            'field' => 'title',
            'slug' => 'slug',
            'replacement' => '-',
        ];

        public function slug(Entity $entity)
        {
            $config = $this->config();
            $value = $entity->get($config['field']);
            $entity->set($config['slug'], Inflector::slug($value, $config['replacement']));
        }

        public function beforeSave(Event $event, EntityInterface $entity)
        {
            $this->slug($entity);
        }

    }

The above code shows a few interesting features of behaviors:

- Behaviors can define callback methods by defining methods that follow the
  :ref:`table-callbacks` conventions.
- Behaviors can define a default configuration property. This property is merged
  with the overrides when a behavior is attached to the table.

To prevent the saving from continuing simply stop event propagation in your callback::

    public function beforeSave(Event $event, EntityInterface $entity)
    {
        if (...) {
            $event->stopPropagation();
            return;
        }
        $this->slug($entity);
    }

Defining Finders
----------------

Now that we are able to save articles with slug values, we should implement
a finder method so we can fetch articles by their slug. Behavior finder
methods, use the same conventions as :ref:`custom-find-methods` do. Our
``find('slug')`` method would look like::

    public function findSlug(Query $query, array $options)
    {
        return $query->where(['slug' => $options['slug']]);
    }

Once our behavior has the above method we can call it::

    $article = $articles->find('slug', ['slug' => $value])->first();

Limiting or Renaming Exposed Finder Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating behaviors, there may be situations where you don't want to expose
finder methods, or you need to rename finders to avoid duplicated methods. In
these cases you can use the ``implementedFinders`` configuration key to rename
or exclude finder methods. For example if we wanted to rename our ``find(slug)``
method we could do the following::

    protected $_defaultConfig = [
        'implementedFinders' => [
            'slugged' => 'findSlug',
        ]
    ];

Applying this configuration will make ``find('slug')`` trigger an error. However
it will make ``find('slugged')`` available. Notably if our behavior implemented
other finder methods they would **not** be available, as they are not included
in the configuration.

Since the exposed methods are decided by configuration you can also
rename/remove finder methods when adding a behavior to a table. For example::

    // In a table's initialize() method.
    $this->addBehavior('Sluggable', [
        'implementedFinders' => [
            'slugged' => 'findSlug',
        ]
    ]);

Transforming Request Data into Entity Properties
================================================

Behaviors can define logic for how the custom fields they provide are
marshalled by implementing the ``Cake\ORM\PropertyMarshalInterface``. This
interface requires a single method to be implemented::

    public function buildMarhshalMap($marshaller, $map, $options)
    {
        return [
            'custom_behavior_field' => function ($value, $entity) {
                // Transform the value as necessary
                return $value . '123';
            }
        ];
    }

The ``TranslateBehavior`` has a non-trivial implementation of this interface
that you might want to refer to.

.. versionadded:: 3.3.0
    The ability for behaviors to participate in marshalling was added in 3.3.0

Removing Loaded Behaviors
=========================

To remove a behavior from your table you can call the ``removeBehavior()`` method::

    // Remove the loaded behavior
    $this->removeBehavior('Sluggable');

Accessing Loaded Behaviors
==========================

Once you've attached behaviors to your Table instance you can introspect the
loaded behaviors, or access specific behaviors using the ``BehaviorRegistry``::

    // See which behaviors are loaded
    $table->behaviors()->loaded();

    // Check if a specific behavior is loaded.
    // Remember to omit plugin prefixes.
    $table->behaviors()->has('CounterCache');

    // Get a loaded behavior
    // Remember to omit plugin prefixes
    $table->behaviors()->get('CounterCache');

Re-configuring Loaded Behaviors
-------------------------------

To modify the configuration of an already loaded behavior you can combine the
``BehaviorRegistry::get`` command with ``config`` command provided by the
``InstanceConfigTrait`` trait.

For example if a parent (e.g. an ``AppTable``) class loaded the ``Timestamp``
behavior you could do the following to add, modify or remove the configurations
for the behavior. In this case, we will add an event we want Timestamp to
respond to::

    namespace App\Model\Table;

    use App\Model\Table\AppTable; // similar to AppController

    class UsersTable extends AppTable
    {
        public function initialize(array $options)
        {
            parent::initialize($options);

            // e.g. if our parent calls $this->addBehavior('Timestamp');
            // and we want to add an additional event
            if ($this->behaviors()->has('Timestamp') {
                $this->behaviors()->get('Timestamp')->config([
                    'events' => [
                        'Users.login' => [
                            'last_login' => 'always'
                        ],
                    ],
                ]);
            }
        }
    }
