Query Builder
#############

.. php:namespace:: Cake\ORM

.. php:class:: Query

The ORM's query builder provides a simple to use fluent interface for creating
and running queries. By composing queries together, you can create advanced
queries using unions and subqueries with ease.

Underneath the covers, the query builder uses PDO prepared statements which
protect against SQL injection attacks.

Query objects are lazily evaluated. This means a query is not executed until one
of the following things occur:

- The query is iterated with ``foreach()``.
- The query's ``execute()`` method is called. This will return the underlying
  statement object, and is to be used with insert/update/delete queries.
- The query's ``all()`` method is called. This will return the result set and
  can only be used with select statements.
- The query's ``toArray()`` method is called.

Until one of these conditions are met, the query can be modified with additional
SQL being sent to the database. It also means that if a Query hasn't been
evaluated, no SQL is ever sent to the database. Once executed, modifying and
re-evaluating a query will result in additional SQL being run.

If you want to take a look at what SQL CakePHP is generating, you can turn
database :ref:`query logging <database-query-logging>` on.

The Query Object
================

The easiest way to create a ``Query`` object is to use ``find()`` from a
``Table`` object. This method will return an incomplete query ready to be
modified. You can also use a table's connection object to access the lower level
Query builder that does not include ORM features, if necessary. See the
:ref:`database-queries` section for more information.  For the remaining
examples, assume that ``$articles`` is a :php:class:`~Cake\\ORM\\Table`::

    // Start a new query.
    $query = $articles->find();

Almost every method in a ``Query`` object will return the same query, this means
that ``Query`` objects are lazy, and will not be executed unless you tell them
to::

    $query->where(['id' => 1]); // Return the same query object
    $query->order(['title' => 'DESC']); // Still same object, no SQL executed

You can of course chain the methods you call on Query objects::

    $query = $articles
        ->find()
        ->select(['id', 'name'])
        ->where(['id !=' => 1])
        ->order(['created' => 'DESC']);

If you try to call ``debug()`` on a Query object, you will see its internal
state and the SQL that will be executed in the database::

    debug($articles->find()->where(['id' => 1]));

    // Outputs
    // ...
    // 'sql' => 'SELECT * FROM articles where id = ?'
    // ...

Once you're happy with the Query, you can execute it. The easiest way is to
either call the ``first()`` or the ``all()`` methods::

    $firstArticle = $articles
        ->find()
        ->where(['id' => 1])
        ->first();

    $allResults = $articles
        ->find()
        ->where(['id >' => 1])
        ->all();

In the above example, ``$allResults`` will be an instance of
``Cake\ORM\ResultSet``, an object you can iterate and apply several extracting
and traversing methods on. Often, there is no need to call ``all()``, you are
allowed to just iterate the Query object to get its results::

    // Iterate the results
    foreach ($allResults as $result) {
     ...
    }

    // That is equivalent to
    $query = $articles->find()->where(['id' => 1]);
    foreach ($query as $result) {
     ...
    }

Query objects can also be used directly as the result object; trying to iterate the query,
calling ``toArray`` or some of the methods inherited from :ref:`Collection<collection-objects>`,
will result in the query being executed and results returned to you::

    // This executes the query and returns an array of results
    $resultsIntoAnArray = $articles->find()->where(['id >' => 1])->toArray();

    // Use the combine() method from the collections library
    // This executes the query
    $keyValueList = $articles->find()->combine('id', 'title');

    // Use the extract() method from the collections library
    // This executes the query as well
    $allTitles = $articles->find()->extract('title');

Once you get familiar with the Query object methods, it is strongly encouraged
that you visit the :ref:`Collection<collection-objects>` section to improve your skills
in efficiently traversing the data. In short, it is important to remember that
anything you can call on a Collection object, you can also do in a Query object::

    // An advanced example
    $results = $articles->find()
        ->where(['id >' => 1])
        ->order(['title' => 'DESC'])
        ->map(function ($row) { // map() is a collection method, it executes the query
            $row->trimmedTitle = trim($row->title);
            return $row;
        });
        ->combine('id', 'trimmedTitle') // combine() is another collection method
        ->toArray(); // Also a collections library method

The following sections will show you everything there is to know about using and
combining the Query object methods to construct SQL statements and extract data.

Selecting Data
==============

Most web applications make heavy use of ``SELECT`` queries. CakePHP makes
building them a snap. To limit the fields fetched, you can use the ``select()``
method::

    $query = $articles->find();
    $query->select(['id', 'title', 'body']);
    foreach ($query as $row) {
        debug($row->title);
    }

You can set aliases for fields by providing fields as an associative array::

    // Results in SELECT id AS pk, title AS aliased_title, body ...
    $query = $articles->find();
    $query->select(['pk' => 'id', 'aliased_title' => 'title', 'body']);

To select distinct fields, you can use the ``distinct()`` method::

    // Results in SELECT DISTINCT country FROM ...
    $query = $articles->find();
    $query->select(['country'])
        ->distinct(['country']);

To set some basic conditions you can use the ``where()`` method::

    // Conditions are combined with AND
    $query = $articles->find();
    $query->where(['title' => 'First Post', 'published' => true]);

    // You can call where() multiple times
    $query = $articles->find();
    $query->where(['title' => 'First Post'])
        ->where(['published' => true]);

See the :ref:`advanced-query-conditions` section to find out how to construct
more complex ``WHERE`` conditions. To apply ordering, you can use the ``order``
method::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->order(['title' => 'ASC', 'id' => 'ASC']);

To limit the number of rows or set the row offset you can use the ``limit()``
and ``page()`` methods::

    // Fetch rows 50 to 100
    $query = $articles->find()
        ->limit(50)
        ->page(2);

As you can see from the examples above, all the methods that modify the query
provide a fluent interface, allowing you to build a query through chained method
calls.

Using SQL Functions
-------------------

CakePHP's ORM offers abstraction for some commonly used SQL functions. Using the
abstraction allows the ORM to select the platform specific implementation of the
function you want. For example, ``concat`` is implemented differently in MySQL,
Postgres and SQLServer. Using the abstraction allows your code to be portable::

    // Results in SELECT COUNT(*) count FROM ...
    $query = $articles->find();
    $query->select(['count' => $query->func()->count('*')]);

A number of commonly used functions can be created with the ``func()`` method:

- ``sum()`` Calculate a sum. The arguments will be treated as literal values.
- ``avg()`` Calculate an average. The arguments will be treated as literal values.
- ``min()`` Calculate the min of a column. The arguments will be treated as
  literal values.
- ``max()`` Calculate the max of a column. The arguments will be treated as
  literal values.
- ``count()`` Calculate the count. The arguments will be treated as literal
  values.
- ``concat()`` Concatenate two values together. The arguments are treated as
  bound parameters unless marked as literal.
- ``coalesce()`` Coalesce values. The arguments are treated as bound parameters
  unless marked as literal.
- ``dateDiff()`` Get the difference between two dates/times. The arguments are
  treated as bound parameters unless marked as literal.
- ``now()`` Take either 'time' or 'date' as an argument allowing you to get
  either the current time, or current date.

When providing arguments for SQL functions, there are two kinds of parameters
you can use, literal arguments and bound parameters. Literal parameters allow
you to reference columns or other SQL literals. Bound parameters can be used to
safely add user data to SQL functions. For example::

    $query = $articles->find();
    $concat = $query->func()->concat([
        'title' => 'literal',
        ' NEW'
    ]);
    $query->select(['title' => $concat]);

By making arguments with a value of ``literal``, the ORM will know that
the key should be treated as a literal SQL value. The above would generate the
following SQL on MySQL::

    SELECT CONCAT(title, :c0) FROM articles;

The ``:c0`` value will have the ``' NEW'`` text bound when the query is
executed.

Aggregates - Group and Having
-----------------------------

When using aggregate functions like ``count`` and ``sum`` you may want to use
``group by`` and ``having`` clauses::

    $query = $articles->find();
    $query->select([
        'count' => $query->func()->count('view_count'),
        'published_date' => 'DATE(created)'
    ])
    ->group('published_date')
    ->having(['count >' => 3]);

Disabling Hydration
-------------------

While ORMs and object result sets are powerful, hydrating entities is sometimes
unnecessary. For example, when accessing aggregated data, building an Entity may
not make sense. In these situations you may want to disable entity hydration::

    $query = $articles->find();
    $query->hydrate(false);

.. note::

    When hydration is disabled results will be returned as basic arrays.

.. _advanced-query-conditions:

Advanced Conditions
===================

The query builder makes it simple to build complex ``where`` clauses.
Grouped conditions can be expressed by providing combining ``where()``,
``andWhere()`` and ``orWhere()``. The ``where()`` method works similar to the
conditions arrays in previous versions of CakePHP::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where([
            'author_id' => 3,
            'OR' => [['view_count' => 2], ['view_count' => 3]],
        ]);

The above would generate SQL like::

    SELECT * FROM articles WHERE author_id = 3 AND (view_count = 2 OR view_count = 3)

If you'd prefer to avoid deeply nested arrays, you can use the ``orWhere()`` and
``andWhere()`` methods to build your queries. Each method sets the combining
operator used between the current and previous condition. For example::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(['author_id' => 2])
        ->orWhere(['author_id' => 3]);

The above will output SQL similar to::

    SELECT * FROM articles WHERE (author_id = 2 OR author_id = 3)

By combining ``orWhere()`` and ``andWhere()``, you can express complex
conditions that use a mixture of operators::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(['author_id' => 2])
        ->orWhere(['author_id' => 3])
        ->andWhere([
            'published' => true,
            'view_count >' => 10
        ])
        ->orWhere(['promoted' => true]);

The above generates SQL similar to::

    SELECT *
    FROM articles
    WHERE (promoted = true
    OR (
      (published = true AND view_count > 10)
      AND (author_id = 2 OR author_id = 3)
    ))

By using functions as the parameters to ``orWhere()`` abd ``andWhere()``,
you can easily compose conditions together with the expression objects::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(['title LIKE' => '%First%'])
        ->andWhere(function ($exp) {
            return $exp->or_([
                'author_id' => 2,
                'is_highlighted' => true
            ]);
        });

The above would create SQL like::

    SELECT *
    FROM articles
    WHERE ((author_id = 2 OR is_highlighted = 1)
    AND title LIKE '%First%')

The expression object that is passed into ``where()`` functions has two kinds of
methods. The first type of methods are **combinators**. The ``and_()`` and
``or_()`` methods create new expression objects that change **how** conditions
are combined. The second type of methods are **conditions**. Conditions are
added into an expression where they are combined with the current combinator.

For example, calling ``$exp->and_(...)`` will create a new ``Expression`` object
that combines all conditions it contains with ``AND``. While ``$exp->or_()``
will create a new ``Expression`` object that combines all conditions added to it
with ``OR``. An example of adding conditions with an ``Expression`` object would
be::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(function ($exp) {
            return $exp
                ->eq('author_id', 2)
                ->eq('published', true)
                ->notEq('spam', true)
                ->gt('view_count', 10);
        });

Since we started off using ``where()``, we don't need to call ``and_()``, as that
happens implicitly. Much like how we would not need to call ``or_()``, had we
started our query with ``orWhere()``. The above shows a few new condition
methods being combined with ``AND``. The resulting SQL would look like::

    SELECT *
    FROM articles
    WHERE (
    author_id = 2
    AND published = 1
    AND spam != 1
    AND view_count > 10)

However, if we wanted to use both ``AND`` & ``OR`` conditions we could do the
following::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(function ($exp) {
            $orConditions = $exp->or_(['author_id' => 2])
                ->eq('author_id', 5);
            return $exp
                ->add($orConditions)
                ->eq('published', true)
                ->gte('view_count', 10);
        });

Which would generate the SQL similar to::

    SELECT *
    FROM articles
    WHERE (
    (author_id = 2 OR author_id = 5)
    AND published = 1
    AND view_count > 10)

The ``or_()`` and ``and_()`` methods also allow you to use functions as their
parameters. This is often easier to read than method chaining::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(function ($exp) {
            $orConditions = $exp->or_(function ($or) {
                return $or->eq('author_id', 2)
                    ->eq('author_id', 5);
            });
            return $exp
                ->not($orConditions)
                ->lte('view_count', 10);
        });

You can negate sub-expressions using ``not()``::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(function ($exp) {
            $orConditions = $exp->or_(['author_id' => 2])
                ->eq('author_id', 5);
            return $exp
                ->not($orConditions)
                ->lte('view_count', 10);
        });

Which will generate the following SQL looking like::

    SELECT *
    FROM articles
    WHERE (
    NOT (author_id = 2 OR author_id = 5)
    AND view_count <= 10)


When using the expression objects you can use the following methods to create
conditions:

- ``eq()`` Creates an equality condition.
- ``notEq()`` Create an inequality condition
- ``like()`` Create a condition using the ``LIKE`` operator.
- ``notLike()`` Create a negated ``LIKE`` condition.
- ``in()`` Create a condition using ``IN``.
- ``notIn()`` Create a negated condition using ``IN``.
- ``gt()`` Create a ``>`` condition.
- ``gte()`` Create a ``>=`` condition.
- ``lt()`` Create a ``<`` condition.
- ``lte()`` Create a ``<=`` condition.
- ``isNull()`` Create an ``IS NULL`` condition.
- ``isNotNull()`` Create a negated ``IS NULL`` condition.

Automatically Creating IN Clauses
---------------------------------

When building queries using the ORM, you will generally not have to indicate the
data types of the columns you are interacting with, as CakePHP can infer the
types based on the schema data. If in your queries you'd like CakePHP to
automatically convert equality to ``IN`` comparisons, you'll need to indicate
the column data type::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(['id' => $ids], ['id' => 'integer[]']);

    // Or include IN to automatically cast to an array.
    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(['id IN' => $ids]);

The above will automatically create ``id IN (...)`` instead of ``id = ?``. This
can be useful when you do not know whether you will get a scalar or array of
parameters. The ``[]`` suffix on any data type name indicates to the query
builder that you want the data handled as an array. If the data is not an array,
it will first be cast to an array. After that, each value in the array will
be cast using the :ref:`type system <database-data-types>`. This works with
complex types as well. For example, you could take a list of DateTime objects
using::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(['post_date' => $dates], ['post_date' => 'date[]']);

Automatic IS NULL Creation
--------------------------

When a condition value is expected to be ``null`` or any other value, you can use
the ``IS`` operator to automatically create the correct expression::

    $query = $categories->find()
        ->where(['parent_id IS' => $parentId]);


The above will create ``parent_id` = :c1`` or ``parent_id IS NULL`` depending on the type of ``$parentId``


Raw Expressions
---------------

When you cannot construct the SQL you need using the query builder, you can use
expression objects to add snippets of SQL to your queries::

    $query = $articles->find();
    $expr = $query->newExpr()->add('1 + 1');
    $query->select(['two' => $expr]);

``Expression`` objects can be used with any query builder methods like
``where()``, ``limit()``, ``group()``, ``select()`` and many other methods.

.. warning::

    Using expression objects leaves you vulnerable to SQL injection. You should
    avoid interpolating user data into expressions.

Getting Results
===============

Once you've made your query, you'll want to retrieve rows from it. There are
a few ways of doing this::

    // Iterate the query
    foreach ($query as $row) {
        // Do stuff.
    }

    // Get the results
    $results = $query->all();

You can use :doc:`any of the collection </core-libraries/collections>` methods
on you query objects to pre-process or transform the results::

    // Use one of the collection methods.
    $ids = $query->map(function ($row) {
        return $row->id;
    });

    $maxAge = $query->max(function ($row) {
        return $max->age;
    });

You can use ``first`` or ``firstOrFail`` to retrieve a single record. These
methods will alter the query adding a ``LIMIT 1`` clause::

    // Get just the first row
    $row = $query->first();

    // Get the first row or an exception.
    $row = $query->firstOrFail();

.. _query-count:

Returning the Total Count of Records
------------------------------------

Using a single query object, it is possible to obtain the total number of rows
found for a set of conditions::

    $total = $articles->find()->where(['is_active' => true])->count();

The ``count()`` method will ignore the ``limit``, ``offset`` and ``page``
clauses, thus the following will return the same result::

    $total = $articles->find()->where(['is_active' => true])->limit(10)->count();

This is useful when you need to know the total result set size in advance,
without having to construct another ``Query`` object. Likewise, all result
formatting and map-reduce routines are ignored when using the ``count()``
method.

Moreover, it is possible to return the total count for a query containing group
by clauses without having to rewrite the query in any way. For example, consider
this query for retrieving article ids and their comments count::

    $query = $articles->find();
    $query->find()
        ->select(['Articles.id', $query->func()->count('Comments.id')])
        ->matching('Comments')
        ->group(['Articles.id']);
    $total = $query->count();

After counting, the query can still be used for fetching the associated
records::

    $list = $query->all();

Sometimes, you may want to provide an alternate method for counting the total
records of a query. One common use case for this is providing
a cached value or an estimate of the total rows, or to alter the query to remove
expensive unneeded parts such as left joins. This becomes particularly handy
when using the CakePHP built-in pagination system which calls the ``count()``
method::

    $query = $query->where(['is_active' => true])->counter(function ($query) {
        return 100000;
    });
    $query->count(); // Returns 100000

In the example above, when the pagination component calls the count method, it
will receive the estimated hard-coded number of rows.

.. _caching-query-results:

Caching Loaded Results
----------------------

When fetching entities that don't change often you may want to cache the
results. The ``Query`` class makes this simple::

    $query->cache('recent_articles');

Will enable caching on the query's result set. If only one argument is provided
to ``cache()`` then the 'default' cache configuration will be used. You can
control which caching configuration is used with the second parameter::

    // String config name.
    $query->cache('recent_articles', 'dbResults');

    // Instance of CacheEngine
    $query->cache('recent_articles', $memcache);

In addition to supporting static keys, the ``cache()`` method accepts a function
to generate the key. The function you give it will receive the query as an
argument. You can then read aspects of the query to dynamically generate the
cache key::

    // Generate a key based on a simple checksum
    // of the query's where clause
    $query->cache(function ($q) {
        return 'articles-' . md5(serialize($q->clause('where')));
    });

The cache method makes it simple to add cached results to your custom finders or
through event listeners.

When the results for a cached query are fetched the following happens:

1. The ``Model.beforeFind`` event is triggered.
2. If the query has results set, those will be returned.
3. The cache key will be resolved and cache data will be read. If the cache data
   is not empty, those results will be returned.
4. If the cache misses, the query will be executed and a new ``ResultSet`` will be
   created. This ``ResultSet`` will be written to the cache and returned.

.. note::

    You cannot cache a streaming query result.

Loading Associations
====================

The builder can help you retrieve data from multiple tables at the same time
with the minimum amount of queries possible. To be able to fetch associated
data, you first need to setup associations between the tables as described in
the :ref:`table-associations` section. This technique of combining queries
to fetch associated data from other tables is called **eager loading**.

.. include:: ./table-objects.rst
    :start-after: start-contain
    :end-before: end-contain

Adding Joins
------------

In addition to loading related data with ``contain()``, you can also add
additional joins with the query builder::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->hydrate(false)
        ->join([
            'table' => 'comments',
            'alias' => 'c',
            'type' => 'LEFT',
            'conditions' => 'c.article_id = articles.id',
        ]);

You can append multiple joins at the same time by passing an associative array
with multiple joins::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->hydrate(false)
        ->join([
            'c' => [
                'table' => 'comments',
                'type' => 'LEFT',
                'conditions' => 'c.article_id = articles.id',
            ],
            'u' => [
                'table' => 'users',
                'type' => 'INNER',
                'conditions' => 'u.id = articles.user_id',
            ]
        ]);

As seen above, when adding joins the alias can be the outer array key. Join
conditions can also be expressed as an array of conditions::

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->hydrate(false)
        ->join([
            'c' => [
                'table' => 'comments',
                'type' => 'LEFT',
                'conditions' => [
                    'c.created >' => new DateTime('-5 days'),
                    'c.moderated' => true,
                    'c.article_id = articles.id'
                ]
            ],
        ], ['a.created' => 'datetime', 'c.moderated' => 'boolean']);

When creating joins by hand and using array based conditions, you need to
provide the datatypes for each column in the join conditions. By providing
datatypes for the join conditions, the ORM can correctly convert data types into
SQL.

Inserting Data
==============

Unlike earlier examples, you should not use ``find()`` to create insert queries.
Instead, create a new ``Query`` object using ``query()``::

    $query = $articles->query();
    $query->insert(['title', 'body'])
        ->values([
            'title' => 'First post',
            'body' => 'Some body text'
        ])
        ->execute();

Generally, it is easier to insert data using entities and
:php:meth:`~Cake\\ORM\\Table::save()`. By composing a ``SELECT`` and
``INSERT`` query together, you can create ``INSERT INTO ... SELECT`` style
queries::

    $select = $articles->find()
        ->select(['title', 'body', 'published'])
        ->where(['id' => 3]);

    $query = $articles->query()
        ->insert(['title', 'body', 'published'])
        ->values($select)
        ->execute();

Updating Data
=============

As with insert queries, you should not use ``find()`` to create update queries.
Instead, create new a ``Query`` object using ``query()``::

    $query = $articles->query();
    $query->update()
        ->set(['published' => true])
        ->where(['id' => $id])
        ->execute();

Generally, it is easier to update data using entities and
:php:meth:`~Cake\\ORM\\Table::patchEntity()`.

More Complex Queries
====================

The query builder is capable of building complex queries like ``UNION`` queries
and sub-queries.

Unions
------

Unions are created by composing one or more select queries together::

    $inReview = $articles->find()
        ->where(['need_review' => true]);

    $unpublished = $articles->find()
        ->where(['published' => false]);

    $unpublished->union($inReview);

You can create ``UNION ALL`` queries using the ``unionAll`` method::

    $inReview = $articles->find()
        ->where(['need_review' => true]);

    $unpublished = $articles->find()
        ->where(['published' => false]);

    $unpublished->unionAll($inReview);

Subqueries
----------

Subqueries are a powerful feature in relational databases and building them in
CakePHP is fairly intuitive. By composing queries together, you can make
subqueries::

    $matchingComment = $articles->association('Comments')->find()
        ->select(['article_id'])
        ->distinct()
        ->where(['comment LIKE' => '%CakePHP%']);

    $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(['id' => $matchingComment]);

Subqueries are accepted anywhere a query expression can be used. For example, in
the ``select()`` and ``join()`` methods.

.. _format-results:

Adding Calculated Fields
========================

After your queries, you may need to do some post-processing. If you need to add
a few calculated fields or derived data, you can use the ``formatResults()``
method. This is a lightweight way to map over the result sets. If you need more
control over the process, or want to reduce results you should use
the :ref:`Map/Reduce <map-reduce>` feature instead. If you were querying a list
of people, you could easily calculate their age with a result formatter::

    // Assuming we have built the fields, conditions and containments.
    $query->formatResults(function (\Cake\Datasource\ResultSetInterface $results, \Cake\Database\Query $query) {
        return $results->map(function ($row) {
            $row['age'] = $row['birth_date']->diff(new \DateTime)->y;
            return $row;
        });
    });

As you can see in the example above, formatting callbacks will get a
``ResultSetDecorator`` as their first argument. The second argument will be
the Query instance the formatter was attached to. The ``$results`` argument can
be traversed and modified as necessary.

Result formatters are required to return an iterator object, which will be used
as the return value for the query. Formatter functions are applied after all the
Map/Reduce routines have been executed. Result formatters can be applied from
within contained associations as well. CakePHP will ensure that your formatters
are properly scoped. For example, doing the following would work as you may
expect::

    // In a method in the Articles table
    $query->contain(['Authors' => function ($q) {
        return $q->formatResults(function ($authors) {
            return $authors->map(function ($author) {
                $author['age'] = $author['birth_date']->diff(new \DateTime)->y;
                return $author;
            });
        });
    });

    // Get results
    $results = $query->all();

    // Outputs 29
    echo $results->first()->author->age;

As seen above, the formatters attached to associated query builders are scoped
to operate only on the data in the association. CakePHP will ensure that
computed values are inserted into the correct entity.

.. _map-reduce:

Modifying Results with Map/Reduce
==================================

More often than not, find operations require post-processing the data that is
found in the database. While entities' getter methods can take care of most of
the virtual property generation or special data formatting, sometimes you
need to change the data structure in a more fundamental way.

For those cases, the ``Query`` object offers the ``mapReduce()`` method, which
is a way of processing results once they are fetched from the database.

A common example of changing the data structure is grouping results together
based on certain conditions. For this task we can use the ``mapReduce()``
function. We need two callable functions the ``$mapper`` and the ``$reducer``.
The ``$mapper`` callable receives the current result from the database as first
argument, the iteration key as second argument and finally it receives an
instance of the ``MapReduce`` routine it is running::

    $mapper = function ($article, $key, $mapReduce) {
        $status = 'published';
        if ($article->isDraft() || $article->isInReview()) {
            $status = 'unpublished';
        }
        $mapReduce->emitIntermediate($article, $status);
    };

In the above example ``$mapper`` is calculating the status of an article, either
published or unpublished, then it calls ``emitIntermediate()`` on the
``MapReduce`` instance. The method stores the article in the list of articles
labelled as either published or unpublished.

The next step in the map-reduce process is to consolidate the final results. For
each status created in the mapper, the ``$reducer`` function will be called so
you can do any extra processing. This function will receive the list of articles
in a particular ``bucket`` as the first parameter, the name of the ``bucket`` it
needs to process as the second parameter, and again, as in the ``mapper()``
function, the instance of the ``MapReduce`` routine as the third parameter. In
our example, we did not have to do any extra processing, so we just ``emit()``
the final results::

    $reducer = function ($articles, $status, $mapReduce) {
        $mapReduce->emit($articles, $status);
    };

Finally, we can put these two functions together to do the grouping::

    $articlesByStatus = $articles->find()
        ->where(['author_id' => 1])
        ->mapReduce($mapper, $reducer);

    foreach ($articlesByStatus as $status => $articles) {
        echo sprintf("The are %d %s articles", count($articles), $status);
    }

The above will ouput the following lines::

    There are 4 published articles
    There are 5 unpublished articles

Of course, this is a simplistic example that could actually be solved in another
way without the help of a map-reduce process. Now, let's take a look at another
example in which the reducer function will be needed to do something more than
just emitting the results.

Calculating the most commonly mentioned words, where the articles contain
information about CakePHP, as usual we need a mapper function::

    $mapper = function ($article, $key, $mapReduce) {
        if (stripos('cakephp', $article['body']) === false) {
            return;
        }

        $words = array_map('strtolower', explode(' ', $article['body']));
        foreach ($words as $word) {
            $mapReduce->emitIntermediate($article['id'], $word);
        }
    };

It first checks for whether the "cakephp" word in in the article's body, and
then breaks the body into individual words. Each word will create its own
``bucket`` where each article id will be stored. Now let's reduce our results to
only extract the count::

    $reducer = function ($occurrences, $word, $mapReduce) {
        $mapReduce->emit(count($occurrences), $word);
    }

Finally, we put everything together::

    $articlesByStatus = $articles->find()
        ->where(['published' => true])
        ->andWhere(['published_date >=' => new DateTime('2014-01-01')])
        ->hydrate(false)
        ->mapReduce($mapper, $reducer);

This could return a very large array if we don't clean stop words, but it could
look something like like this::

    [
        'cakephp' => 100,
        'awesome' => 39,
        'impressive' => 57,
        'outstanding' => 10,
        'mind-blowing' => 83
    ]

One last example and you will be a map-reduce expert. Imagine you have
a ``friends`` table and you want to find "fake friends" in our database, or
better said, people who do not follow each other. Let's start with our
``mapper`` function::

    $mapper = function ($rel, $key, $mr) {
        $mr->emitIntermediate($rel['source_user_id'], $rel['target_user_id']);
        $mr->emitIntermediate($rel['target_user_id'], $rel['source_target_id']);
    };

We just duplicated our data to have a list of users each other user follows.
Now it's time to reduce it. For each call to the reducer, it will receive a list
of followers per user::

    // $friends list will look like
    // repeated numbers mean that the relationship existed in both directions
    [2, 5, 100, 2, 4]

    $reducer = function ($friendsList, $user, $mr) {
        $friends = array_count_values($friendsList);
        foreach ($friends as $friend => $count) {
            if ($count < 2) {
                $mr->emit($friend, $user);
            }
        }
    }

And we supply our functions to a query::

    $fakeFriends = $friends->find()
        ->hydrate(false)
        ->mapReduce($mapper, $reducer)
        ->toArray();

This would return an array similar to this::

    [
        1 => [2, 4],
        3 => [6]
        ...
    ]

The resulting array means, for example, that user with id ``1`` follows users
``2`` and ``4``, but those do not follow ``1`` back.


Stacking Multiple Operations
----------------------------

Using `mapReduce` in a query will not execute it immediately. The operation will
be registered to be run as soon as the first result is attempted to be fetched.
This allows you to keep chaining additional methods and filters to the query
even after adding a map-reduce routine::

   $query = $articles->find()
        ->where(['published' => true])
        ->mapReduce($mapper, $reducer);

    // At a later point in your app:
    $query->where(['created >=' => new DateTime('1 day ago')]);

This is particularly useful for building custom finder methods as described in the
:ref:`custom-find-methods` section::

    public function findPublished(Query $query, array $options]) {
        return $query->where(['published' => true]);
    }

    public function findRecent(Query $query, array $options) {
        return $query->where(['created >=' => new DateTime('1 day ago')]);
    }

    public function findCommonWords(Query $query, array $options) {
        // Same as in the common words example in the previous section
        $mapper = ...;
        $reducer = ...;
        return $query->mapReduce($mapper, $reducer);
    }

    $commonWords = $articles
        ->find('commonWords')
        ->find('published')
        ->find('recent');

Moreover, it is also possible to stack more than one ``mapReduce`` operation for
a single query. For example, if we wanted to have the most commonly used words
for articles, but then filter it to only return words that were mentioned more
than 20 times across all articles::

    $mapper = function ($count, $word, $mr) {
        if ($count > 20) {
            $mr->emit($count, $word);
        }
    };

    $articles->find('commonWords')->mapReduce($mapper);

Removing All Stacked Map-reduce Operations
------------------------------------------

Under some circumstances you may want to modify a ``Query`` object so that no
``mapReduce`` operations are executed at all. This can be easily done by
calling the method with both parameters as null and the third parameter
(overwrite) as ``true``::

    $query->mapReduce(null, null, true);
