Error Handling
##############

For 2.0 ``Object::cakeError()`` has been removed. Instead it has been replaced with
a number of exceptions.  All of the core classes that previously called cakeError
are now throwing exceptions.  This lets you either choose to handle the errors
in your application code, or let the built in exception handling deal with them.

There is more control than ever for error and exception handling in CakePHP 2.0.
You can configure which methods you want to set as the default error handler,
and exception handler using configure.

Error configuration
===================

Error configuration is done inside your application's ``app/config/core.php``
file.  You can define a callback to be fired each time your application triggers
any PHP error - exceptions are handled :doc:`/development/exceptions` separately.
The callback can be any PHP callable, including an anonymous function.  The 
default error handling configuration looks like::

    Configure::write('Error', array(
        'handler' => 'ErrorHandler::handleError',
        'level' => E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED,
        'trace' => true
    ));

You have 3 built-in options when configuring error handlers:

* ``handler`` - callback - The callback to handle errors. You can set this to any
  callback type, including anonymous functions.
* ``level`` - int - The level of errors you are interested in capturing. Use the 
  built-in php error constants, and bitmasks to select the level of error you 
  are interested in.
* ``trace`` - boolean - Include stack traces for errors in log files.  Stack traces 
  will be included in the log after each error.  This is helpful for finding 
  where/when errors are being raised.

ErrorHandler by default, displays errors when ``debug`` > 0, and logs errors when 
debug = 0.  The type of errors captured in both cases is controlled by ``Error.level``.

.. note::

    If you use a custom error handler, the trace setting will have no effect, 
    unless you refer to it in your error handling function.

Creating your own error handler
===============================

You can create an error handler out of any callback type.  For example you could 
use a class called ``AppError`` to handle your errors.  The following would 
need to be done::

    <?php
    //in app/Config/core.php
    Configure::write('Error.handler', 'AppError::handleError');

    //in app/config/bootstrap.php
    App::uses('AppError', 'Lib');

    //in app/Lib/AppError.php
    class AppError {
        public static function handleError($code, $description, $file = null, $line = null, $context = null) {
            echo 'There has been an error!';
        }
    }

This class/method will print out 'There has been an error!' each time an error 
occurs.  Since you can define an error handler as any callback type, you could
use an anonymous function if you are using PHP5.3 or greater.::

    <?php
    Configure::write('Error.handler', function($code, $description, $file = null, $line = null, $context = null) {
        echo 'Oh no something bad happened';
    });

It is important to remember that errors captured by the configured error handler will be php
errors, and that if you need custom error handling, you probably also want to configure
:doc:`/development/exceptions` handling as well.
