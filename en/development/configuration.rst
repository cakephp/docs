Configuration
#############

While conventions remove the need to configure all of CakePHP, you'll still need
to configure a few things like your database credentials.

Additionally, there are optional configuration options that allow you to swap
out default values & implementations with ones tailored to your application.

.. index:: app.php, app_local.example.php

.. index:: configuration

Configuring your Application
============================

Configuration is generally stored in either PHP or INI files, and loaded during
the application bootstrap. CakePHP comes with one configuration file by default,
but if required you can add additional configuration files and load them in
your application's bootstrap code. :php:class:`Cake\\Core\\Configure` is used
for global configuration, and classes like ``Cache`` provide ``setConfig()``
methods to make configuration simple and transparent.

The application skeleton features a **config/app.php** file which should contain
configuration that doesn't vary across the various environments your application
is deployed in. The **config/app_local.php** file should contain the
configuration data that varies between environments and shouldn't be checked
into version control. Both of these files reference environment variables
through the ``env()`` function that enables configuration values to set though
the server environment.

Loading Additional Configuration Files
--------------------------------------

If your application has many configuration options it can be helpful to split
configuration into multiple files. After creating each of the files in your
**config/** directory you can load them in **bootstrap.php**::

    use Cake\Core\Configure;
    use Cake\Core\Configure\Engine\PhpConfig;

    Configure::setConfig('default', new PhpConfig());
    Configure::load('app', 'default', false);
    Configure::load('other_config', 'default');

.. _environment-variables:

Environment Variables
=====================

Many modern cloud providers, like Heroku, let you define environment
variables for configuration data. You can configure your CakePHP through
environment variables in the `12factor app style <http://12factor.net/>`_.
Environment variables allow your application to require less state making your
application easier to manage when it is deployed across a number of
environments.

As you can see in your **app.php**, the ``env()`` function is used to read
configuration from the environment, and build the application configuration.
CakePHP uses :term:`DSN` strings for databases, logs, email transports and cache
configurations allowing you to easily vary these libraries in each environment.

For local development, CakePHP leverages `dotenv
<https://github.com/josegonzalez/php-dotenv>`_ to allow easy local development using
environment variables. You will see a ``config/.env.example`` in your
application. By copying this file into ``config/.env`` and customizing the
values you can configure your application.

You should avoid committing the ``config/.env`` file to your repository and
instead use the ``config/.env.example`` as a template with placeholder values so
everyone on your team knows what environment variables are in use and what
should go in each one.

Once your environment variables have been set, you can use ``env()`` to read
data from the environment::

    $debug = env('APP_DEBUG', false);

The second value passed to the env function is the default value. This value
will be used if no environment variable exists for the given key.

General Configuration
---------------------

Below is a description of the variables and how they affect your CakePHP
application.

debug
    Changes CakePHP debugging output. ``false`` = Production mode. No error
    messages, errors, or warnings shown. ``true`` = Errors and warnings shown.
App.namespace
    The namespace to find app classes under.

    .. note::

        When changing the namespace in your configuration, you will also
        need to update your **composer.json** file to use this namespace
        as well. Additionally, create a new autoloader by running
        ``php composer.phar dumpautoload``.

.. _core-configuration-baseurl:

App.baseUrl
    Un-comment this definition if you **don’t** plan to use Apache’s
    mod\_rewrite with CakePHP. Don’t forget to remove your .htaccess
    files too.
App.base
    The base directory the app resides in. If ``false`` this
    will be auto detected. If not ``false``, ensure your string starts
    with a `/` and does NOT end with a `/`. E.g., `/basedir` is a valid
    App.base. Otherwise, the AuthComponent will not work properly.
App.encoding
    Define what encoding your application uses.  This encoding
    is used to generate the charset in the layout, and encode entities.
    It should match the encoding values specified for your database.
App.webroot
    The webroot directory.
App.wwwRoot
    The file path to webroot.
App.fullBaseUrl
    The fully qualified domain name (including protocol) to your application's
    root. This is used when generating absolute URLs. By default this value
    is generated using the ``$_SERVER`` environment. However, you should define it
    manually to optimize performance or if you are concerned about people
    manipulating the ``Host`` header.
    In a CLI context (from shells) the `fullBaseUrl` cannot be read from $_SERVER,
    as there is no webserver involved. You do need to specify it yourself if
    you do need to generate URLs from a shell (e.g. when sending emails).
App.imageBaseUrl
    Web path to the public images directory under webroot. If you are using
    a :term:`CDN` you should set this value to the CDN's location.
App.cssBaseUrl
    Web path to the public css directory under webroot. If you are using
    a :term:`CDN` you should set this value to the CDN's location.
App.jsBaseUrl
    Web path to the public js directory under webroot. If you are using
    a :term:`CDN` you should set this value to the CDN's location.
App.paths
    Configure paths for non class based resources. Supports the
    ``plugins``, ``templates``, ``locales`` subkeys, which allow the definition
    of paths for plugins, view templates and locale files respectively.
App.uploadedFilesAsObjects
    Defines whether uploaded files are being represented as objects (``true``),
    or arrays (``false``). This option is being treated as disabled by default.
    See the :ref:`File Uploads section <request-file-uploads>` in the Request &
    Response Objects chapter for more information.
Security.salt
    A random string used in hashing. This value is also used as the
    HMAC salt when doing symetric encryption.
Asset.timestamp
    Appends a timestamp which is last modified time of the particular
    file at the end of asset files URLs (CSS, JavaScript, Image) when
    using proper helpers. Valid values:

    - (bool) ``false`` - Doesn't do anything (default)
    - (bool) ``true`` - Appends the timestamp when debug is ``true``
    - (string) 'force' - Always appends the timestamp.
Asset.cacheTime
    Sets the asset cache time. This determines the http header ``Cache-Control``'s
    ``max-age``, and the http header's ``Expire``'s time for assets.
    This can take anything that you version of php's `strtotime function
    <http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php>`_ can take.
    The default is ``+1 day``.

Using a CDN
-----------

To use a CDN for loading your static assets, change ``App.imageBaseUrl``,
``App.cssBaseUrl``, ``App.jsBaseUrl`` to point the CDN URI, for example:
``https://mycdn.example.com/`` (note the trailing ``/``).

All images, scripts and styles loaded via HtmlHelper will prepend the absolute
CDN path, matching the same relative path used in the application. Please note
there is a specific use case when using plugin based assets: plugins will not
use the plugin's prefix when absolute ``...BaseUrl`` URI is used, for example By
default:

* ``$this->Helper->assetUrl('TestPlugin.logo.png')`` resolves to ``test_plugin/logo.png`` 

If you set ``App.imageBaseUrl`` to ``https://mycdn.example.com/``:

* ``$this->Helper->assetUrl('TestPlugin.logo.png')`` resolves to ``https://mycdn.example.com/logo.png``.

Database Configuration
----------------------

See the :ref:`Database Configuration <database-configuration>` for information
on configuring your database connections.

Caching Configuration
---------------------

See the :ref:`Caching Configuration <cache-configuration>` for information on
configuring caching in CakePHP.

Error and Exception Handling Configuration
------------------------------------------

See the :ref:`Error and Exception Configuration <error-configuration>` for
information on configuring error and exception handlers.

Logging Configuration
---------------------

See the :ref:`log-configuration` for information on configuring logging in
CakePHP.

Email Configuration
-------------------

See the :ref:`Email Configuration <email-configuration>` for information on
configuring email presets in CakePHP.

Session Configuration
---------------------

See the :ref:`session-configuration` for information on configuring session
handling in CakePHP.

Routing configuration
---------------------

See the :ref:`Routes Configuration <routes-configuration>` for more information
on configuring routing and creating routes for your application.

.. _additional-class-paths:

Additional Class Paths
======================

Additional class paths are setup through the autoloaders your application uses.
When using ``composer`` to generate your autoloader, you could do the following,
to provide fallback paths for controllers in your application::

    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\Controller\\": "/path/to/directory/with/controller/folders/",
            "App\\": "src/"
        }
    }

The above would setup paths for both the ``App`` and ``App\Controller``
namespace. The first key will be searched, and if that path does not contain the
class/file the second key will be searched. You can also map a single namespace
to multiple directories with the following::

    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": ["src/", "/path/to/directory/"]
        }
    }

Plugin, View Template and Locale Paths
--------------------------------------

Since plugins, view templates and locales are not classes, they cannot have an
autoloader configured. CakePHP provides three Configure variables to setup additional
paths for these resources. In your **config/app.php** you can set these variables::

    return [
        // More configuration
        'App' => [
            'paths' => [
                'plugins' => [
                    ROOT . DS . 'plugins' . DS,
                    '/path/to/other/plugins/'
                ],
                'templates' => [
                    ROOT . 'templates' . DS,
                    ROOT . 'templates2' . DS
                ],
                'locales' => [
                    ROOT . 'resources' . DS . 'locales' . DS
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ];

Paths should end with a directory separator, or they will not work properly.

Inflection Configuration
========================

See the :ref:`inflection-configuration` docs for more information.

Configure Class
===============

.. php:namespace:: Cake\Core

.. php:class:: Configure

CakePHP's Configure class can be used to store and retrieve
application or runtime specific values. Be careful, this class
allows you to store anything in it, then use it in any other part
of your code: a sure temptation to break the MVC pattern CakePHP
was designed for. The main goal of Configure class is to keep
centralized variables that can be shared between many objects.
Remember to try to live by "convention over configuration" and you
won't end up breaking the MVC structure CakePHP provides.

Writing Configuration data
--------------------------

.. php:staticmethod:: write($key, $value)

Use ``write()`` to store data in the application's configuration::

    Configure::write('Company.name','Pizza, Inc.');
    Configure::write('Company.slogan','Pizza for your body and soul');

.. note::

    The :term:`dot notation` used in the ``$key`` parameter can be used to
    organize your configuration settings into logical groups.

The above example could also be written in a single call::

    Configure::write('Company', [
        'name' => 'Pizza, Inc.',
        'slogan' => 'Pizza for your body and soul'
    ]);

You can use ``Configure::write('debug', $bool)`` to switch between debug and
production modes on the fly. This is especially handy for JSON interactions
where debugging information can cause parsing problems.

Reading Configuration Data
--------------------------

.. php:staticmethod:: read($key = null, $default = null)

Used to read configuration data from the application. If a key is supplied, the
data is returned. Using our examples from write() above, we can read that data
back::

    // Returns 'Pizza Inc.'
    Configure::read('Company.name');

    // Returns 'Pizza for your body and soul'
    Configure::read('Company.slogan');

    Configure::read('Company');
    // Returns:
    ['name' => 'Pizza, Inc.', 'slogan' => 'Pizza for your body and soul'];

    // Returns 'fallback' as Company.nope is undefined.
    Configure::read('Company.nope', 'fallback');

If ``$key`` is left null, all values in Configure will be returned.

.. php:staticmethod:: readOrFail($key)

Reads configuration data just like :php:meth:`Cake\\Core\\Configure::read`
but expects to find a key/value pair. In case the requested pair does not
exist, a :php:class:`RuntimeException` will be thrown::

    Configure::readOrFail('Company.name');    // Yields: 'Pizza, Inc.'
    Configure::readOrFail('Company.geolocation');  // Will throw an exception

    Configure::readOrFail('Company');

    // Yields:
    ['name' => 'Pizza, Inc.', 'slogan' => 'Pizza for your body and soul'];

Checking to see if Configuration Data is Defined
------------------------------------------------

.. php:staticmethod:: check($key)

Used to check if a key/path exists and has non-null value::

    $exists = Configure::check('Company.name');

Deleting Configuration Data
---------------------------

.. php:staticmethod:: delete($key)

Used to delete information from the application's configuration::

    Configure::delete('Company.name');

Reading & Deleting Configuration Data
-------------------------------------

.. php:staticmethod:: consume($key)

Read and delete a key from Configure. This is useful when you want to
combine reading and deleting values in a single operation.

.. php:staticmethod:: consumeOrFail($key)

Consumes configuration data just like :php:meth:`Cake\\Core\\Configure::consume`
but expects to find a key/value pair. In case the requested pair does not
exist, a :php:class:`RuntimeException` will be thrown::

    Configure::consumeOrFail('Company.name');    // Yields: 'Pizza, Inc.'
    Configure::consumeOrFail('Company.geolocation');  // Will throw an exception

    Configure::consumeOrFail('Company');

    // Yields:
    ['name' => 'Pizza, Inc.', 'slogan' => 'Pizza for your body and soul'];

Reading and writing configuration files
=======================================

.. php:staticmethod:: setConfig($name, $engine)

CakePHP comes with two built-in configuration file engines.
:php:class:`Cake\\Core\\Configure\\Engine\\PhpConfig` is able to read PHP config
files, in the same format that Configure has historically read.
:php:class:`Cake\\Core\\Configure\\Engine\\IniConfig` is able to read ini config
files.  See the `PHP documentation <http://php.net/parse_ini_file>`_ for more
information on the specifics of ini files.  To use a core config engine, you'll
need to attach it to Configure using :php:meth:`Configure::config()`::

    use Cake\Core\Configure\Engine\PhpConfig;

    // Read config files from config
    Configure::config('default', new PhpConfig());

    // Read config files from another path.
    Configure::config('default', new PhpConfig('/path/to/your/config/files/'));

You can have multiple engines attached to Configure, each reading different
kinds or sources of configuration files. You can interact with attached engines
using a few other methods on Configure. To check which engine aliases are
attached you can use :php:meth:`Configure::configured()`::

    // Get the array of aliases for attached engines.
    Configure::configured();

    // Check if a specific engine is attached
    Configure::configured('default');

.. php:staticmethod:: drop($name)

You can also remove attached engines. ``Configure::drop('default')``
would remove the default engine alias. Any future attempts to load configuration
files with that engine would fail::

    Configure::drop('default');

.. _loading-configuration-files:

Loading Configuration Files
---------------------------

.. php:staticmethod:: load($key, $config = 'default', $merge = true)

Once you've attached a config engine to Configure you can load configuration
files::

    // Load my_file.php using the 'default' engine object.
    Configure::load('my_file', 'default');

Loaded configuration files merge their data with the existing runtime
configuration in Configure. This allows you to overwrite and add new values into
the existing runtime configuration. By setting ``$merge`` to ``true``, values
will not ever overwrite the existing configuration.

Creating or Modifying Configuration Files
-----------------------------------------

.. php:staticmethod:: dump($key, $config = 'default', $keys = [])

Dumps all or some of the data in Configure into a file or storage system
supported by a config engine. The serialization format is decided by the config
engine attached as $config. For example, if the 'default' engine is
a :php:class:`Cake\\Core\\Configure\\Engine\\PhpConfig`, the generated file will be
a PHP configuration file loadable by the
:php:class:`Cake\\Core\\Configure\\Engine\\PhpConfig`

Given that the 'default' engine is an instance of PhpConfig.
Save all data in Configure to the file `my_config.php`::

    Configure::dump('my_config', 'default');

Save only the error handling configuration::

    Configure::dump('error', 'default', ['Error', 'Exception']);

``Configure::dump()`` can be used to either modify or overwrite
configuration files that are readable with :php:meth:`Configure::load()`

Storing Runtime Configuration
-----------------------------

.. php:staticmethod:: store($name, $cacheConfig = 'default', $data = null)

You can also store runtime configuration values for use in a future request.
Since configure only remembers values for the current request, you will
need to store any modified configuration information if you want to
use it in subsequent requests::

    // Store the current configuration in the 'user_1234' key in the 'default' cache.
    Configure::store('user_1234', 'default');

Stored configuration data is persisted in the named cache configuration. See the
:doc:`/core-libraries/caching` documentation for more information on caching.

Restoring Runtime Configuration
-------------------------------

.. php:staticmethod:: restore($name, $cacheConfig = 'default')

Once you've stored runtime configuration, you'll probably need to restore it
so you can access it again. ``Configure::restore()`` does exactly that::

    // Restore runtime configuration from the cache.
    Configure::restore('user_1234', 'default');

When restoring configuration information it's important to restore it with
the same key, and cache configuration as was used to store it. Restored
information is merged on top of the existing runtime configuration.

Configuration Engines
---------------------

CakePHP provides the ability to load configuration files from a number of
different sources, and features a pluggable system for `creating your own
configuration engines
<https://api.cakephp.org/3.x/class-Cake.Core.Configure.ConfigEngineInterface.html>`__.
The built in configuration engines are:

* `JsonConfig <https://api.cakephp.org/3.x/class-Cake.Core.Configure.Engine.JsonConfig.html>`__
* `IniConfig <https://api.cakephp.org/3.x/class-Cake.Core.Configure.Engine.IniConfig.html>`__
* `PhpConfig <https://api.cakephp.org/3.x/class-Cake.Core.Configure.Engine.PhpConfig.html>`__

By default your application will use ``PhpConfig``.

Disabling Generic Tables
========================

While utilizing generic table classes - also called auto-tables - when quickly
creating new applications and baking models is useful, generic table class can
make debugging more difficult in some scenarios.

You can check if any query was emitted from a generic table class via DebugKit
via the SQL panel in DebugKit. If you're still having trouble diagnosing an
issue that could be caused by auto-tables, you can throw an exception when
CakePHP implicitly uses a generic ``Cake\ORM\Table`` instead of your concrete
class like so::

    // In your bootstrap.php
    use Cake\Event\EventManager;
    use Cake\Http\Exception\InternalErrorException;

    $isCakeBakeShellRunning = (PHP_SAPI === 'cli' && isset($argv[1]) && $argv[1] === 'bake');
    if (!$isCakeBakeShellRunning) {
        EventManager::instance()->on('Model.initialize', function($event) {
            $subject = $event->getSubject();
            if (get_class($subject) === 'Cake\ORM\Table') {
                $msg = sprintf(
                    'Missing table class or incorrect alias when registering table class for database table %s.',
                    $subject->getTable());
                throw new InternalErrorException($msg);
            }
        });
    }
