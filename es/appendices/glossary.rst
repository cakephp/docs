    routing array
        An array of attributes that are passed to :php:meth:`Router::url()`.
        They typically look like::
        
            array('controller' => 'posts', 'action' => 'view', 5)

    html attributes
        An array of key => values that are composed into html attributes. For example::
            
            <?php
            // Given
            array('class' => 'my-class', '_target' => 'blank')

            // Would generate
            class="my-class" _target="blank"

        If an option can be minimized or accepts it's name as the value, then ``true`` 
        can be used::
        
            <?php
            // Given
            array('checked' => true)
            
            // Would generate
            checked="checked"
    
    plugin syntax
        Plugin syntax refers to the dot separated classname indicating classes
        are part of a plugin.  E.g. ``DebugKit.Toolbar`` The plugin is DebugKit,
        and the classname is Toolbar.
    
    dot notation
        Dot notation defines an array path, by separating nested levels with ``.``
        For example::
        
            Asset.filter.css
        
        Would point to the following value::
        
            array(
                'Asset' => array(
                    'filter' => array(
                        'css' => 'got me'
                    )
                )
            )
    CSRF
        Cross Site Request Forgery.  Prevents replay attacks, double
        submissions and forged requests from other domains.

    routes.php
        A file in APP/Config that contains routing configuration.
        This file is included before each request is processed.
        It should connect all the routes your application needs so 
        requests can be routed to the correct controller + action.
