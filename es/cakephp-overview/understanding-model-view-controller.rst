Understanding Model-View-Controller
###################################

CakePHP follows the
`MVC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller>`_
software design pattern. Programming using MVC separates your
application into three main parts:


#. The Model represents the application data
#. The View renders a presentation of model data
#. The Controller handles and routes requests made by the client

Figure: 1: A Basic MVC Request

Figure: 1 shows an example of a bare-bones MVC request in CakePHP.
To illustrate, assume a client named "Ricardo" just clicked on the
“Buy A Custom Cake Now!” link on your application’s home page.


-  Ricardo clicks the link pointing to
   http://www.example.com/cakes/buy, and his browser makes a request
   to your web server.
-  The dispatcher checks the request URL (/cakes/buy), and hands
   the request to the correct controller.
-  The controller performs application specific logic. For example,
   it may check to see if Ricardo has logged in.
-  The controller also uses models to gain access to the
   application’s data. Models usually represent database tables, but
   they could also represent
   `LDAP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ldap>`_ entries,
   `RSS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss>`_ feeds, or files on the
   system. In this example, the controller uses a model to fetch
   Ricardo’s last purchases from the database.
-  Once the controller has worked its magic on the data, it hands
   it to a view. The view takes this data and gets it ready for
   presentation to the client. Views in CakePHP are usually in HTML
   format, but a view could just as easily be a PDF, XML document, or
   JSON object depending on your needs.
-  Once the view has used the data from the controller to build a
   fully rendered view, the content of that view is returned to
   Ricardo’s browser.

Almost every request to your application will follow this basic
pattern. We'll add some details later on which are specific to
CakePHP, so keep this in mind as we proceed.

Benefits
========

Why use MVC? Because it is a tried and true software design pattern
that turns an application into a maintainable, modular, rapidly
developed package. Crafting application tasks into separate models,
views, and controllers makes your application very light on its
feet. New features are easily added, and new faces on old features
are a snap. The modular and separate design also allows developers
and designers to work simultaneously, including the ability to
rapidly
`prototype <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping>`_.
Separation also allows developers to make changes in one part of
the application without affecting the others.

If you've never built an application this way, it takes some time
getting used to, but we're confident that once you've built your
first application using CakePHP, you won't want to do it any other
way.
