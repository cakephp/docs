Helpers
#######

Helpers are the component-like classes for the presentation layer
of your application. They contain presentational logic that is
shared between many views, elements, or layouts.

This section describes each of the helpers that come with CakePHP
such as Form, Html, JavaScript and RSS.

Read :ref:`using-helpers` to learn more about
helpers and how you can build your own helpers.
