Testing
#######

As of CakePHP 1.2 there is support for a comprehensive testing
framework built into CakePHP. The framework is an extension of the
SimpleTest framework for PHP. This section will discuss how to
prepare for testing and how to build and run your tests.

Preparing for testing
=====================

Ready to start testing? Good! Lets get going then!

Installing SimpleTest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing SimpleTest
The testing framework provided with CakePHP 1.3 is built upon the
SimpleTest testing framework. SimpleTest is not shipped with the
default CakePHP installation, so we need to download it first. You
can find it here:
`http://simpletest.sourceforge.net/ <http://simpletest.sourceforge.net/>`_.

Fetch the latest version, and unzip the code to your vendors
folder, or your app/vendors folder, depending on your preference.
You should now have a vendors/simpletest directory with all
SimpleTest files and folders inside. Remember to have a DEBUG level
of at least 1 in your app/config/core.php file before running any
tests!

There is a new version of SimpleTest 1.1alpha that does not work
with CakePHP. Please use 1.0.1.

If you have no test database connection defined in your
app/config/database.php, test tables will be created with a
``test_suite_`` prefix. You can create a ``$test`` database
connection to contain any test tables like the one below::

    <?php
    var $test = array(
        'driver' => 'mysql',
        'persistent' => false,
        'host' => 'dbhost',
        'login' => 'dblogin',
        'password' => 'dbpassword',
        'database' => 'databaseName'
    );

If the test database is available and CakePHP can connect to it,
all tables will be created in this database.

Running Core test cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installing Simpletest, you can run the core test cases. They
are part of every packaged release and can also be found in the
`git repository <http://github.com/cakephp/cakephp>`_.

The tests can then be accessed by browsing to
http://your.cake.domain/test.php - depending on how your specific
setup looks. Try executing one of the core test groups by clicking
on the corresponding link. Executing a test group might take a
while, but you should eventually see something like "2/2 test cases
complete: 49 passes, 0 fails and 0 exceptions.".

Congratulations, you are now ready to start writing tests!

If you run all of the core tests at once or run core test groups
most of them will fail. This is known by the CakePHP developers and
is normal so don't panic. Instead, try running each of the core
test cases individually.

Testing overview - Unit testing vs. Web testing
===============================================

The CakePHP test framework supports two types of testing. One is
Unit Testing, where you test small parts of your code, such as a
method in a component or an action in a controller. The other type
of testing supported is Web Testing, where you automate the work of
testing your application through navigating pages, filling forms,
clicking links and so on.


Preparing test data
===================

When testing code that depends on models and data, one can use
**fixtures** as a way to generate temporary data tables loaded with
sample data that can be used by the test. The benefit of using
fixtures is that your test has no chance of disrupting live
application data. In addition, you can begin testing your code
prior to actually developing live content for an application.

CakePHP attempts to use the connection named ``$test`` in your
app/config/database.php configuration file. If this connection is
not usable, it will use the ``$default`` database configuration and
create the test tables in the database defined in that
configuration. In either case, it will add "test\_suite\_" to your
own table prefix (if any) to prevent collision with your existing
tables.

CakePHP performs the following during the course of a fixture based
test case:


#. Creates tables for each of the fixtures needed
#. Populates tables with data, if data is provided in fixture
#. Runs test methods
#. Empties the fixture tables
#. Removes fixture tables from database

Creating fixtures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a fixture you will mainly define two things: how the
table is created (which fields are part of the table), and which
records will be initially populated to the test table. Let's then
create our first fixture, that will be used to test our own Article
model. Create a file named **article\_fixture.php** in your
**app/tests/fixtures** directory, with the following content::

    <?php  
     class ArticleFixture extends CakeTestFixture { 
          var $name = 'Article'; 
           
          var $fields = array( 
              'id' => array('type' => 'integer', 'key' => 'primary'), 
              'title' => array('type' => 'string', 'length' => 255, 'null' => false), 
              'body' => 'text', 
              'published' => array('type' => 'integer', 'default' => '0', 'null' => false), 
              'created' => 'datetime', 
              'updated' => 'datetime' 
          ); 
          var $records = array( 
              array ('id' => 1, 'title' => 'First Article', 'body' => 'First Article Body', 'published' => '1', 'created' => '2007-03-18 10:39:23', 'updated' => '2007-03-18 10:41:31'), 
              array ('id' => 2, 'title' => 'Second Article', 'body' => 'Second Article Body', 'published' => '1', 'created' => '2007-03-18 10:41:23', 'updated' => '2007-03-18 10:43:31'), 
              array ('id' => 3, 'title' => 'Third Article', 'body' => 'Third Article Body', 'published' => '1', 'created' => '2007-03-18 10:43:23', 'updated' => '2007-03-18 10:45:31') 
          ); 
     } 
     ?> 

The ``$name`` variable is extremely significant. If you omit it,
cake will use the wrong table names when it sets up your test
database, and you'll get strange errors that are difficult to
debug. If you use PHP 5.2, you might be used to writing model
classes without ``$name``, but you must remember to include it in
your fixture files.

We use $fields to specify which fields will be part of this table,
on how they are defined. The format used to define these fields is
the same used in the function **generateColumnSchema()** defined on
Cake's database engine classes (for example, on file
dbo\_mysql.php.) Let's see the available attributes a field can
take and their meaning:

type
    CakePHP internal data type. Currently supported: string (maps to
    VARCHAR), text (maps to TEXT), integer (maps to INT), float (maps
    to FLOAT), datetime (maps to DATETIME), timestamp (maps to
    TIMESTAMP), time (maps to TIME), date (maps to DATE), and binary
    (maps to BLOB)
key
    set to primary to make the field AUTO\_INCREMENT, and a PRIMARY KEY
    for the table.
length
    set to the specific length the field should take.
null
    set to either true (to allow NULLs) or false (to disallow NULLs)
default
    default value the field takes.

We lastly can set a set of records that will be populated after the
test table is created. The format is fairly straight forward and
needs little further explanation. Just keep in mind that each
record in the $records array must have a key for **every** field
specified in the $fields array. If a field for a particular record
needs to have a NULL value, just specify the value of that key as
NULL.

Importing table information and records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your application may have already working models with real data
associated to them, and you might decide to test your model with
that data. It would be then a duplicate effort to have to define
the table definition and/or records on your fixtures. Fortunately,
there's a way for you to define that table definition and/or
records for a particular fixture come from an existing model or an
existing table.
Let's start with an example. Assuming you have a model named
Article available in your application (that maps to a table named
articles), change the example fixture given in the previous section
(**app/tests/fixtures/article\_fixture.php**) to:::

    <?php  
    class ArticleFixture extends CakeTestFixture { 
          var $name = 'Article'; 
          var $import = 'Article'; 
    } 
    ?> 
     

This statement tells the test suite to import your table definition
from the table linked to the model called Article. You can use any
model available in your application. The statement above does not
import records, you can do so by changing it to::

    <?php   
    class ArticleFixture extends CakeTestFixture {
        var $name = 'Article';
        var $import = array('model' => 'Article', 'records' => true);  
    }
    ?> 

If on the other hand you have a table created but no model
available for it, you can specify that your import will take place
by reading that table information instead. For example::

     <?php  
       class ArticleFixture extends CakeTestFixture { 
              var $name = 'Article'; 
              var $import = array('table' => 'articles'); 
       } 
     ?> 

Will import table definition from a table called 'articles' using
your CakePHP database connection named 'default'. If you want to
change the connection to use just do::

     <?php  
       class ArticleFixture extends CakeTestFixture { 
       var $name = 'Article'; 
       var $import = array('table' => 'articles', 'connection' => 'other'); 
       } 
       ?> 

Since it uses your CakePHP database connection, if there's any
table prefix declared it will be automatically used when fetching
table information. The two snippets above do not import records
from the table. To force the fixture to also import its records,
change it to::

     <?php  
       class ArticleFixture extends CakeTestFixture { 
              var $name = 'Article'; 
              var $import = array('table' => 'articles', 'records' => true); 
       } 
     ?> 

You can naturally import your table definition from an existing
model/table, but have your records defined directly on the fixture
as it was shown on previous section. For example::

     <?php
       class ArticleFixture extends CakeTestFixture {
              var $name = 'Article';
              var $import = 'Article';

              var $records = array(
                  array ('id' => 1, 'title' => 'First Article', 'body' => 'First Article Body', 'published' => '1', 'created' => '2007-03-18 10:39:23', 'updated' => '2007-03-18 10:41:31'),
                  array ('id' => 2, 'title' => 'Second Article', 'body' => 'Second Article Body', 'published' => '1', 'created' => '2007-03-18 10:41:23', 'updated' => '2007-03-18 10:43:31'),
                  array ('id' => 3, 'title' => 'Third Article', 'body' => 'Third Article Body', 'published' => '1', 'created' => '2007-03-18 10:43:23', 'updated' => '2007-03-18 10:45:31')
              );
       }
     ?>

Creating tests
==============

First, lets go through a number of rules, or guidelines, concerning
tests:


#. PHP files containing tests should be in your
   **app/tests/cases/[some\_folder]**.
#. The filenames of these files should end in **.test.php** instead
   of just .php.
#. The classes containing tests should extend **CakeTestCase** or
   **CakeWebTestCase**.
#. The name of any method containing a test (i.e. containing an
   assertion) should begin with **test**, as in **testPublished()**.

When you have created a test case, you can execute it by browsing
to **http://your.cake.domain/cake\_folder/test.php** (depending on
how your specific setup looks) and clicking App test cases, and
then click the link to your specific file.

CakeTestCase Callback Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to sneak in some logic just before or after an
individual CakeTestCase method, and/or before or after your entire
CakeTestCase, the following callbacks are available:

**start()**
First method called in a *test case*.

**end()**
Last method called in a *test case*.

**startCase()**
called before a *test case* is started.

**endCase()**
called after a *test case* has run.

**before($method)**
Announces the start of a *test method*.

**after($method)**
Announces the end of a *test method*.

**startTest($method)**
Called just before a *test method* is executed.

**endTest($method)**
Called just after a *test method* has completed.

.. todo::

    Update this to reflect PHPUnit's API's


Testing models
==============

Let's say we already have our Article model defined on
app/models/article.php, which looks like this::

     <?php  
       class Article extends AppModel { 
              var $name = 'Article'; 
               
              function published($fields = null) { 
                  $params = array( 
                        'conditions' => array(
                              $this->name . '.published' => 1 
                        ),
                        'fields' => $fields
                  ); 
                   
                  return $this->find('all',$params); 
              } 
       
       } 
     ?> 

We now want to set up a test that will use this model definition,
but through fixtures, to test some functionality in the model.
CakePHP test suite loads a very minimum set of files (to keep tests
isolated), so we have to start by loading our parent model (in this
case the Article model which we already defined), and then inform
the test suite that we want to test this model by specifying which
DB configuration it should use. CakePHP test suite enables a DB
configuration named **test\_suite** that is used for all models
that rely on fixtures. Setting $useDbConfig to this configuration
will let CakePHP know that this model uses the test suite database
connection.

CakePHP Models will only use the test\_suite DB config if they rely
on fixtures in your testcase!

Since we also want to reuse all our existing model code we will
create a test model that will extend from Article, set $useDbConfig
and $name appropiately. Let's now create a file named
**article.test.php** in your **app/tests/cases/models** directory,
with the following contents::

     <?php  
       App::import('Model','Article'); 
    
       
       class ArticleTestCase extends CakeTestCase { 
              var $fixtures = array( 'app.article' ); 
       } 
     ?> 

We have created the ArticleTestCase. In variable **$fixtures** we
define the set of fixtures that we'll use.

If your model is associated with other models, you will need to
include ALL the fixtures for each associated model even if you
don't use them. For example: A hasMany B hasMany C hasMany D. In
ATestCase you will have to include fixtures for a, b, c and d.

Creating a test method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's now add a method to test the function published() in the
Article model. Edit the file
**app/tests/cases/models/article.test.php** so it now looks like
this::

      <?php
        App::import('Model', 'Article');
        
        class ArticleTestCase extends CakeTestCase {
            var $fixtures = array( 'app.article' );
        
            function testPublished() {
                $this->Article =& ClassRegistry::init('Article');
        
                $result = $this->Article->published(array('id', 'title'));
                $expected = array(
                    array('Article' => array( 'id' => 1, 'title' => 'First Article' )),
                    array('Article' => array( 'id' => 2, 'title' => 'Second Article' )),
                    array('Article' => array( 'id' => 3, 'title' => 'Third Article' ))
                );
        
                $this->assertEqual($result, $expected);
            }
        }
        ?>    

You can see we have added a method called **testPublished()**. We
start by creating an instance of our fixture based **Article**
model, and then run our **published()** method. In **$expected** we
set what we expect should be the proper result (that we know since
we have defined which records are initally populated to the article
table.) We test that the result equals our expectation by using the
**assertEqual** method. See the section Creating Tests for
information on how to run the test.

Testing controllers
===================

Say you have a typical articles controller, with its corresponding
model, and it looks like this::

    <?php 
    class ArticlesController extends AppController { 
       var $name = 'Articles'; 
       var $helpers = array('Ajax', 'Form', 'Html'); 
       
       function index($short = null) { 
         if (!empty($this->data)) { 
           $this->Article->save($this->data); 
         } 
         if (!empty($short)) { 
           $result = $this->Article->findAll(null, array('id', 
              'title')); 
         } else { 
           $result = $this->Article->findAll(); 
         } 
     
         if (isset($this->params['requested'])) { 
           return $result; 
         } 
     
         $this->set('title', 'Articles'); 
         $this->set('articles', $result); 
       } 
    } 
    ?>

Create a file named articles\_controller.test.php in your
app/tests/cases/controllers directory and put the following
inside::

    <?php 
    class ArticlesControllerTest extends CakeTestCase { 
       function startCase() { 
         echo '<h1>Starting Test Case</h1>'; 
       } 
       function endCase() { 
         echo '<h1>Ending Test Case</h1>'; 
       } 
       function startTest($method) { 
         echo '<h3>Starting method ' . $method . '</h3>'; 
       } 
       function endTest($method) { 
         echo '<hr />'; 
       } 
       function testIndex() { 
         $result = $this->testAction('/articles/index'); 
         debug($result); 
       } 
       function testIndexShort() { 
         $result = $this->testAction('/articles/index/short'); 
         debug($result); 
       } 
       function testIndexShortGetRenderedHtml() { 
         $result = $this->testAction('/articles/index/short', 
         array('return' => 'render')); 
         debug(htmlentities($result)); 
       } 
       function testIndexShortGetViewVars() { 
         $result = $this->testAction('/articles/index/short', 
         array('return' => 'vars')); 
         debug($result); 
       } 
       function testIndexFixturized() { 
         $result = $this->testAction('/articles/index/short', 
         array('fixturize' => true)); 
         debug($result); 
       } 
       function testIndexPostFixturized() { 
         $data = array('Article' => array('user_id' => 1, 'published' 
              => 1, 'slug'=>'new-article', 'title' => 'New Article', 'body' => 'New Body')); 
         $result = $this->testAction('/articles/index', 
         array('fixturize' => true, 'data' => $data, 'method' => 'post')); 
         debug($result); 
       } 
    } 
    ?> 

The testAction method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new thing here is the **testAction** method. The first argument
of that method is the Cake url of the controller action to be
tested, as in '/articles/index/short'.

The second argument is an array of parameters, consisting of:

return
    Set to what you want returned.
    Valid values are:
    
    -  'vars' - You get the view vars available after executing action
    -  'view' - You get The rendered view, without the layout
    -  'contents' - You get the rendered view's complete html,
       including the layout
    -  'result' - You get the returned value when action uses
       $this->params['requested'].

    The default is 'result'.
fixturize
    Set to true if you want your models auto-fixturized (so your
    application tables get copied, along with their records, to test
    tables so if you change data it does not affect your real
    application.) If you set 'fixturize' to an array of models, then
    only those models will be auto-fixturized while the other will
    remain with live tables. If you wish to use your fixture files with
    testAction() do not use fixturize, and instead just use fixtures as
    you normally would.
method
    set to 'post' or 'get' if you want to pass data to the controller
data
    the data to be passed. Set it to be an associative array consisting
    of fields => value. Take a look at
    ``function testIndexPostFixturized()`` in above test case to see
    how we emulate posting form data for a new article submission.

Pitfalls
~~~~~~~~

If you use testAction to test a method in a controller that does a
redirect, your test will terminate immediately, not yielding any
results.
See
`https://trac.cakephp.org/ticket/4154 <https://trac.cakephp.org/ticket/4154>`_
for a possible fix.

Testing Helpers
===============

Since a decent amount of logic resides in Helper classes, it's
important to make sure those classes are covered by test cases.

Helper testing is a bit similar to the same approach for
Components. Suppose we have a helper called CurrencyRendererHelper
located in ``app/views/helpers/currency_renderer.php`` with its
accompanying test case file located in
``app/tests/cases/helpers/currency_renderer.test.php``

Creating Helper test, part I
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all we will define the responsibilities of our
CurrencyRendererHelper. Basically, it will have two methods just
for demonstration purpose:

function usd($amount)
This function will receive the amount to render. It will take 2
decimal digits filling empty space with zeros and prefix 'USD'.

function euro($amount)
This function will do the same as usd() but prefix the output with
'EUR'. Just to make it a bit more complex, we will also wrap the
result in span tags::

    <span class="euro"></span> 

Let's create the tests first::

    <?php
    
    //Import the helper to be tested.
    //If the tested helper were using some other helper, like Html, 
    //it should be impoorted in this line, and instantialized in startTest().
    App::import('Helper', 'CurrencyRenderer');
    
    class CurrencyRendererTest extends CakeTestCase {
        private $currencyRenderer = null;
    
        //Here we instantiate our helper, and all other helpers we need.
        public function startTest() {
            $this->currencyRenderer = new CurrencyRendererHelper();
        }
    
        //testing usd() function.
        public function testUsd() {
            $this->assertEqual('USD 5.30', $this->currencyRenderer->usd(5.30));
            //We should always have 2 decimal digits.
            $this->assertEqual('USD 1.00', $this->currencyRenderer->usd(1));
            $this->assertEqual('USD 2.05', $this->currencyRenderer->usd(2.05));
            //Testing the thousands separator
            $this->assertEqual('USD 12,000.70', $this->currencyRenderer->usd(12000.70));
        }
    }

Here, we call ``usd()`` with different parameters and tell the test
suite to check if the returned values are equal to what is
expected.

Executing the test now will result in errors (because
currencyRendererHelper doesn't even exist yet) showing that we have
3 fails.

Once we know what our method should do, we can write the method
itself::

    <?php
    class CurrencyRendererHelper extends AppHelper {
        public function usd($amount) {
            return 'USD ' . number_format($amount, 2, '.', ',');
        }
    }

Here we set the decimal places to 2, decimal separator to dot,
thousands separator to comma, and prefix the formatted number with
'USD' string.

Save this in app/views/helpers/currency\_renderer.php and execute
the test. You should see a green bar and messaging indicating 4
passes.

Testing components
==================

Lets assume that we want to test a component called
TransporterComponent, which uses a model called Transporter to
provide functionality for other controllers. We will use four
files:


-  A component called Transporters found in
   **app/controllers/components/transporter.php**
-  A model called Transporter found in
   **app/models/transporter.php**
-  A fixture called TransporterTestFixture found in
   **app/tests/fixtures/transporter\_fixture.php**
-  The testing code found in
   **app/tests/cases/transporter.test.php**

Initializing the component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since :doc:`/controllers/components`
we need a controller to access the data in the model.

If the startup() function of the component looks like this:::

    <?php
    public function startup(&$controller){ 
              $this->Transporter = $controller->Transporter;  
     }

then we can just design a really simple fake class::

    class FakeTransporterController {} 

and assign values into it like this::

    <?php
    $this->TransporterComponentTest = new TransporterComponent(); 
    $controller = new FakeTransporterController(); 
    $controller->Transporter = new TransporterTest(); 
    $this->TransporterComponentTest->startup(&$controller); 

Creating a test method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just create a class that extends CakeTestCase and start writing
tests!

::

    <?php
    class TransporterTestCase extends CakeTestCase {
        var $fixtures = array('transporter');
        function testGetTransporter() {
            $this->TransporterComponentTest = new TransporterComponent();
            $controller = new FakeTransporterController();
            $controller->Transporter = new TransporterTest();
            $this->TransporterComponentTest->startup(&$controller);

            $result = $this->TransporterComponentTest->getTransporter("12345", "Sweden", "54321", "Sweden");
            $this->assertEqual($result, 1, "SP is best for 1xxxx-5xxxx");

            $result = $this->TransporterComponentTest->getTransporter("41234", "Sweden", "44321", "Sweden");
            $this->assertEqual($result, 2, "WSTS is best for 41xxx-44xxx");

            $result = $this->TransporterComponentTest->getTransporter("41001", "Sweden", "41870", "Sweden");
            $this->assertEqual($result, 3, "GL is best for 410xx-419xx");

            $result = $this->TransporterComponentTest->getTransporter("12345", "Sweden", "54321", "Norway");
            $this->assertEqual($result, 0, "Noone can service Norway");
        }
    }


Testing plugins
===============

Tests for plugins are created in their own directory inside the
plugins folder.::

    /app
         /plugins
             /pizza
                 /tests
                      /cases
                      /fixtures
                      /groups

They work just like normal tests but you have to remember to use
the naming conventions for plugins when importing classes. This is
an example of a testcase for the PizzaOrder model from the plugins
chapter of this manual. A difference from other tests is in the
first line where 'Pizza.PizzaOrder' is imported. You also need to
prefix your plugin fixtures with '``plugin.plugin_name.``'.

::

    <?php 
    App::import('Model', 'Pizza.PizzaOrder');

    class PizzaOrderCase extends CakeTestCase {

        // Plugin fixtures located in /app/plugins/pizza/tests/fixtures/
        var $fixtures = array('plugin.pizza.pizza_order');
        var $PizzaOrderTest;

        function testSomething() {
            // ClassRegistry makes the model use the test database connection
            $this->PizzaOrderTest =& ClassRegistry::init('PizzaOrder');

            // do some useful test here
            $this->assertTrue(is_object($this->PizzaOrderTest));
        }
    }
    ?>

If you want to use plugin fixtures in the app tests you can
reference them using 'plugin.pluginName.fixtureName' syntax in the
$fixtures array.


Creating a test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In keeping with the other testing conventions, you should create
your view tests in tests/cases/views. You can, of course, put those
tests anywhere but following the conventions whenever possible is
always a good idea. So let's create the file
tests/cases/views/complete\_web.test.php

First, when you want to write web tests, you must remember to
extend **CakeWebTestCase** instead of CakeTestCase:

::

    class CompleteWebTestCase extends CakeWebTestCase

If you need to do some preparation before you start the test,
create a constructor::

    <?php
    function CompleteWebTestCase(){
      //Do stuff here
    }

When writing the actual test cases, the first thing you need to do
is get some output to look at. This can be done by doing a **get**
or **post** request, using **get()**or **post()** respectively.
Both these methods take a full url as the first parameter. This can
be dynamically fetched if we assume that the test script is located
under http://your.domain/cake/folder/webroot/test.php by typing::

    <?php
    $this->baseurl = current(split("webroot", $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']));

You can then do gets and posts using Cake urls, like this::

    <?php
    $this->get($this->baseurl."/products/index/");
    $this->post($this->baseurl."/customers/login", $data);

The second parameter to the post method, **$data**, is an
associative array containing the post data in Cake format::

    <?php
    $data = array(
      "data[Customer][mail]" => "user@user.com",
      "data[Customer][password]" => "userpass");

When you have requested the page you can do all sorts of asserts on
it, using standard SimpleTest web test methods.

Walking through a page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CakeWebTest also gives you an option to navigate through your page
by clicking links or images, filling forms and clicking buttons.
Please refer to the SimpleTest documentation for more information
on that.


Miscellaneous
=============

.. todo::

    Rewrite.  This is incorrect.

Customizing the test reporter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard test reporter is **very** minimalistic. If you want
more shiny output to impress someone, fear not, it is actually very
easy to extend. By creating a new reporter and making a request
with a matching ``output`` GET parameter you can get test results
with a custom reporter.

Reporters generate the visible output from the test suite. There
are two built in reporters: Text and Html. By default all web
requests use the Html reporter. You can create your own reporters
by creating files in your app/libs. For example you could create
the file ``app/libs/test_suite/reporters/my_reporter.php`` and in
it create the following:

::

    require_once CAKE_TEST_LIB . 'reporter' . DS . 'cake_base_reporter.php';
    
    class MyReporter extends CakeBaseReporter {
        //methods go here.
    }

Extending ``CakeBaseReporter`` or one of its subclasses is not
required, but strongly suggested as you may get missing errors
otherwise. ``CakeBaseReporter`` encapsulates a few common test
suite features such as test case timing and code coverage report
generation. You can use your custom reporter by setting the
``output`` query string parameter to the reporter name minus
'reporter'. For the example above you would set ``output=my`` to
use your custom reporter.

Test Reporter methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reporters have a number of methods used to generate the various
parts of a Test suite response.

paintDocumentStart()
    Paints the start of the response from the test suite. Used to paint
    things like head elements in an html page.
paintTestMenu()
    Paints a menu of available test cases.
testCaseList()
    Retrieves and paints the list of tests cases.
groupCaseList()
    Retrieves and paints the list of group tests.
paintHeader()
    Prints before the test case/group test is started.
paintPass()
    Prints everytime a test case has passed. Use $this->getTestList()
    to get an array of information pertaining to the test, and $message
    to get the test result. Remember to call
    parent::paintPass($message).
paintFail()
    Prints everytime a test case has failed. Remember to call
    parent::paintFail($message).
paintSkip()
    Prints everytime a test case has been skipped. Remember to call
    parent::paintSkip($message).
paintException()
    Prints everytime there is an uncaught exception. Remember to call
    parent::paintException($message).
    /dd
paintError()
    Prints everytime an error is raised. Remember to call
    parent::paintError($message).
paintFooter()
    Prints when the test case/group test is over, i.e. when all test
    cases has been executed.
paintDocumentEnd()
    Paints the end of the response from the test suite. Used to paint
    things like footer elements in an html page.

Grouping tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want several of your test to run at the same time, you can
try creating a test group. Create a file in **/app/tests/groups/**
and name it something like **your\_test\_group\_name.group.php**.
In this file, extend **TestSuite** and import test as follows:

::

    <?php
    class TryGroupTest extends TestSuite {
      var $label = 'try';
      function tryGroupTest() {
        TestManager::addTestCasesFromDirectory($this, APP_TEST_CASES . DS . 'models');
      }
    }
    ?>

The code above will group all test cases found in the
``/app/tests/cases/models/`` folder. To add an individual file, use
``TestManager::addTestFile($this, filename)``.

Running tests in the Command Line
=================================

If you have simpletest installed you can run your tests from the
command line of your application.

from **app/**
::

    cake testsuite help


::

    Usage: 
        cake testsuite category test_type file
            - category - "app", "core" or name of a plugin
            - test_type - "case", "group" or "all"
            - test_file - file name with folder prefix and without the (test|group).php suffix
    
    Examples: 
            cake testsuite app all
            cake testsuite core all
    
            cake testsuite app case behaviors/debuggable
            cake testsuite app case models/my_model
            cake testsuite app case controllers/my_controller
    
            cake testsuite core case file
            cake testsuite core case router
            cake testsuite core case set
    
            cake testsuite app group mygroup
            cake testsuite core group acl
            cake testsuite core group socket
    
            cake testsuite bugs case models/bug
              // for the plugin 'bugs' and its test case 'models/bug'
            cake testsuite bugs group bug
              // for the plugin bugs and its test group 'bug'
    
    Code Coverage Analysis: 
    
    
    Append 'cov' to any of the above in order to enable code coverage analysis

As the help menu suggests, you'll be able to run all, part, or just
a single test case from your app, plugin, or core, right from the
command line.

If you have a model test of **test/models/my\_model.test.php**
you'd run just that test case by running:

::

    cake testsuite app models/my_model

Test Suite changes in 1.3
=========================

The TestSuite harness for 1.3 was heavily refactored and partially
rebuilt. The number of constants and global functions have been
greatly reduced. Also the number of classes used by the test suite
has been reduced and refactored. You **must** update
``app/webroot/test.php`` to continue using the test suite. We hope
that this will be the last time that a change is required to
``app/webroot/test.php``.

**Removed Constants**


-  ``CAKE_TEST_OUTPUT``
-  ``RUN_TEST_LINK``
-  ``BASE``
-  ``CAKE_TEST_OUTPUT_TEXT``
-  ``CAKE_TEST_OUTPUT_HTML``

These constants have all been replaced with instance variables on
the reporters and the ability to switch reporters.

**Removed functions**


-  ``CakePHPTestHeader()``
-  ``CakePHPTestSuiteHeader()``
-  ``CakePHPTestSuiteFooter()``
-  ``CakeTestsGetReporter()``
-  ``CakePHPTestRunMore()``
-  ``CakePHPTestAnalyzeCodeCoverage()``
-  ``CakePHPTestGroupTestList()``
-  ``CakePHPTestCaseList()``

These methods and the logic they contained have been
refactored/rewritten into ``CakeTestSuiteDispatcher`` and the
relevant reporter classes. This made the test suite more modular
and easier to extend.

**Removed Classes**


-  HtmlTestManager
-  TextTestManager
-  CliTestManager

These classes became obsolete as logic was consolidated into the
reporter classes.

**Modified methods/classes**

The following methods have been changed as noted.


-  ``TestManager::getExtension()`` is no longer static.
-  ``TestManager::runAllTests()`` is no longer static.
-  ``TestManager::runGroupTest()`` is no longer static.
-  ``TestManager::runTestCase()`` is no longer static.
-  ``TestManager::getTestCaseList()`` is no longer static.
-  ``TestManager::getGroupTestList()`` is no longer static.

**testsuite Console changes**

The output of errors, exceptions, and failures from the testsuite
console tool have been updated to remove redundant information and
increase readability of the messages. If you have other tools built
upon the testsuite console, be sure to update those tools with the
new formatting.

**CodeCoverageManager changes**


-  ``CodeCoverageManager::start()``'s functionality has been moved
   to ``CodeCoverageManager::init()``
-  ``CodeCoverageManager::start()`` now starts coverage generation.
-  ``CodeCoverageManager::stop()`` pauses collection
-  ``CodeCoverageManager::clear()`` stops and clears collected
   coverage reports.
