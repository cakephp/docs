Transactions
############

To perform a transaction, a model's tables must be of a type that
supports transactions.

All transaction methods must be performed on a model's DataSource
object. To get a model's DataSource from within the model, use:

::

        $dataSource = $this->getDataSource();

You can then use the data source to start, commit, or roll back
transactions.

::

        $dataSource->begin($this);
        
        //Perform some tasks
    
        if(/*all's well*/) {
            $dataSource->commit($this);
        } else {
            $dataSource->rollback($this);
        }

Nested transactions are currently not supported. If a nested
transaction is started, a commit will return false on the parent
transaction.
