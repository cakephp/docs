Router
######

Router can be used to parse urls into arrays containing indexes for the
controller, action, and any parameters, and the opposite: to convert url
arrays (eg. array('controller'=>'posts', 'action'=>'index')) to string
urls.

Router also include other utility methods for dealing with urls.
