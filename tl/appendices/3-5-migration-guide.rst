3.5 Migration Guide
###################

CakePHP 3.5 is an API compatible upgrade from 3.4. This page outlines the
changes and improvements made in 3.5.

To upgrade to 3.5.x run the following composer command:

.. code-block:: bash

    php composer.phar require --update-with-dependencies "cakephp/cakephp:3.5.*"

Deprecations
============

The following is a list of deprecated methods, properties and behaviors. These
features will continue to function until 4.0.0 after which they will be removed.

* ``Cake\Http\Client\CookieCollection`` is deprecated. Use
  ``Cake\Http\Cookie\CookieCollection`` instead.
* ``Cake\View\Helper\RssHelper`` is deprecated. Due to infrequent use the
  RssHelper is deprecated.
* ``Cake\Controller\Component\CsrfComponent`` is deprecated. Use
  :ref:`csrf-middleware` instead.
* ``Cake\Datasource\TableSchemaInterface`` is deprecated. Use
  ``Cake\Database\TableSchemaAwareInterface`` instead.
* ``Cake\Console\ShellDispatcher`` is deprecated. Applications should update to
  use ``Cake\Console\CommandRunner`` instead.
* ``Cake\Database\Schema\TableSchema::column()`` is deprecated. Use
  ``Cake\Database\Schema\TableSchema::getColumn()`` instead.
* ``Cake\Database\Schema\TableSchema::constraint()`` is deprecated. Use
  ``Cake\Database\Schema\TableSchema::getConstraint()`` instead.
* ``Cake\Database\Schema\TableSchema::index()`` is deprecated. Use
  ``Cake\Database\Schema\TableSchema::getIndex()`` instead.

Deprecated Combined Get/Set Methods
-----------------------------------

In the past CakePHP has leveraged 'modal' methods that provide both
a get and set mode. These methods complicate IDE autocompletion and our ability
to add stricter return types in the future. For these reasons, combined get/set
methods are being split into separate get and set methods.

The following is a list of methods that are deprecated and replaced with
``getX()`` and ``setX()`` methods:

``Cake\Cache\Cache``
    * ``config()``
    * ``registry()``
``Cake\Console\Shell``
    * ``io()``
``Cake\Console\ConsoleIo``
    * ``outputAs()``
``Cake\Console\ConsoleOutput``
    * ``outputAs()``
``Cake\Database\Connection``
    * ``logger()``
``Cake\Database\TypedResultInterface``
    * ``returnType()``
``Cake\Database\TypedResultTrait``
    * ``returnType()``
``Cake\Database\Log\LoggingStatement``
    * ``logger()``
``Cake\Datasource\ModelAwareTrait``
    * ``modelType()``
``Cake\Database\Query``
    * getter part of ``valueBinder()`` (now ``getValueBinder()``)
``Cake\Database\Schema\TableSchema``
    * ``columnType()``
``Cake\Datasource\QueryTrait``
    * getter part of ``eagerLoaded()`` (now ``isEagerLoaded()``)
``Cake\Event\EventDispatcherInterface``
    * ``eventManager()``
``Cake\Event\EventDispatcherTrait``
    * ``eventManager()``
``Cake\Error\Debugger``
    * ``outputAs()`` (now ``getOutputFormat()`` / ``setOutputFormat()``)
``Cake\Http\ServerRequest``
    * ``env()`` (now ``getEnv()`` / ``withEnv()``)
    * ``charset()`` (now ``getCharset()`` / ``withCharset()``)
``Cake\I18n\I18n``
    * ``locale()``
    * ``translator()``
    * ``defaultLocale()``
    * ``defaultFormatter()``
``Cake\ORM\Association\BelongsToMany``
    * ``sort()``
``Cake\ORM\LocatorAwareTrait``
    * ``tableLocator()``
``Cake\ORM\EntityTrait``
    * ``invalid()`` (now ``getInvalid()``, ``setInvalid()``,
      ``setInvalidField()``, and ``getInvalidField()``)
``Cake\ORM\Table``
    * ``validator()``
``Cake\Routing\RouteBuilder``
    * ``extensions()``
    * ``routeClass()``
``Cake\Routing\RouteCollection``
    * ``extensions()``
``Cake\TestSuite\TestFixture``
    * ``schema()``

    * ``salt()``
``Cake\View\View``
    * ``template()``
    * ``layout()``
    * ``theme()``
    * ``templatePath()``
    * ``layoutPath()``
    * ``autoLayout()`` (now ``isAutoLayoutEnabled()`` / ``enableAutoLayout()``)

Behavior Changes
================

While these changes are API compatible, they represent minor variances in
behavior that may affect your application:

* ``BehaviorRegistry``, ``HelperRegistry`` and ``ComponentRegistry`` will now
  raise exceptions when ``unload()`` is called with an unknown object name. This
  change should help find errors easier by making possible typos more visible.
* ``HasMany`` associations now gracefully handle empty values set for the
  association property, similar to ``BelongsToMany`` associations - that is they
  treat ``false``, ``null``, and empty strings the same way as empty arrays. For
  ``HasMany`` associations this now results in all associated records to be
  deleted/unlinked when the ``replace`` save strategy is being used.
  As a result this allows you to use forms to delete/unlink all associated
  records by passing an empty string. Previously this would have required custom
  marshalling logic.
* ``ORM\Table::newEntity()`` now only marks association properties dirty if the
  marshalled association record is dirty. In scenarios where an association
  entity is created that contains no properties the empty record will not be
  flagged for persistence.
* ``Http\Client`` no longer uses the ``cookie()`` method results when building
  requests. Instead the ``Cookie`` header and internal CookieCollection are
  used. This should only effect applications that have a custom HTTP adapter in
  their clients.
* Multi-word subcommand names previouly required camelBacked names to be used
  when invoking shells. Now subcommands can be invoked with underscored_names.
  For example: ``cake tool initMyDb`` can now be called with ``cake tool
  init_my_db``. If your shells previously bound two subcommands with different
  inflections, only the last bound command will function.
* ``SecurityComponent`` will blackhole post requests that have no request data
  now. This change helps protect actions that create records using database
  defaults alone.
* ``Cake\ORM\Table::addBehavior()`` and ``removeBehavior()`` now return
  ``$this`` to assist in defining table objects in a fluent fashion.
* Cache engines no longer throw an exception when they fail or are misconfigured,
  but instead fall back to the noop ``NullEngine``. Fallbacks can also be
  :ref:`configured <cache-configuration-fallback>` on a per-engine basis.
* ``Cake\Database\Type\DateTimeType`` will now marshal ISO-8859-1 formatted
  datetime strings (e.g. 2017-07-09T12:33:00+00:02) in addition to the
  previously accepted format. If you have a subclass of DateTimeType you may
  need to update your code.

New Features
============

Scoped Middleware
-----------------

Middleware can now be conditionally applied to routes in specific URL
scopes. This allows you to build specific stacks of middleware for different
parts of your application without having to write URL checking code in your
middleware. See the :ref:`connecting-scoped-middleware` section for more
information.

New Console Runner
------------------

3.5.0 adds ``Cake\Console\CommandRunner``. This class alongside
``Cake\Console\CommandCollection`` integrate the CLI environment with the new
``Application`` class. Application classes can now implement a ``console()``
hook that allows them to have full control over which CLI commands are exposed,
how they are named and how the shells get their dependencies. Adopting this new
class requires replacing the contents of your ``bin/cake.php`` file with the
`following file <https://github.com/cakephp/app/tree/3.next/bin/cake.php>`_.

Cache Engine Fallbacks
----------------------

Cache engines can now be configured with a ``fallback`` key that defines a
cache configuration to fall back to if the engine is misconfigured (or
unavailable). See :ref:`cache-configuration-fallback` for more information on
configuring fallbacks.

dotenv Support added to Application Skeleton
--------------------------------------------

The application skeleton now features a 'dotenv' integration making it easier to
use environment variables to configure your application. See the
:ref:`environment-variables` section for more information.

Console Integration Testing
---------------------------

The ``Cake\TestSuite\ConsoleIntegrationTestCase`` class was added to make
integration testing console applications easier. For more information, visit
the :ref:`console-integration-testing` section. This test class is fully
compatible with the current ``Cake\Console\ShellDispatcher`` as well as the new
``Cake\Console\CommandRunner``.

Collection
----------

* ``Cake\Collection\Collection::avg()`` was added.
* ``Cake\Collection\Collection::median()`` was added.

Core
----

* ``Cake\Core\Configure::read()`` now supports default values if the desired key
  does not exist.
* ``Cake\Core\ObjectRegistry`` now implements the ``Countable`` and
  ``IteratorAggregate`` interfaces.

Console
-------

* ``Cake\Console\ConsoleOptionParser::setHelpAlias()`` was added. This method
  allows you to set the command name used when generating help output. Defaults
  to ``cake``.
* ``Cake\Console\CommandRunnner`` was added replacing
  ``Cake\Console\ShellDispatcher``.
* ``Cake\Console\CommandCollection`` was added to provide an interface for
  applications to define the command line tools they offer.

Database
--------

* SQLite driver had the ``mask`` option added. This option lets you set the
  file permissions on the SQLite database file when it is created.

Datasource
----------

* ``Cake\Datasource\SchemaInterface`` was added.
* New abstract types were added for ``smallinteger`` and ``tinyinteger``.
  Existing ``SMALLINT`` and ``TINYINT`` columns will now be reflected as these
  new abstract types. ``TINYINT(1)`` columns will continue to be treated as
  boolean columns in MySQL.
* ``Cake\Datasource\PaginatorInterface`` was added. The ``PaginatorComponent``
  now uses this interface to interact with paginators. This allows other
  ORM-like implementations to be paginated by the component.
* ``Cake\Datasource\Paginator`` was added to paginate ORM/Database Query
  instances.

Event
-----

* ``Cake\Event\EventManager::on()`` and ``off()`` methods are now chainable
  making it simpler to set multiple events at once.

Http
----

* New ``Cookie`` & ``CookieCollection`` classes have been added. These classes allow you
  to work with cookies in an object-orientated way, and are available on
  ``Cake\Http\ServerRequest``, ``Cake\Http\Response``, and
  ``Cake\Http\Client\Response``. See the :ref:`request-cookies` and
  :ref:`response-cookies` for more information.
* New middleware has been added to make applying security headers easier. See
  :ref:`security-header-middleware` for more information.
* New middleware has been added to transparently encrypt cookie data. See
  :ref:`encrypted-cookie-middleware` for more information.
* New middleware has been added to make protecting against CSRF easier. See
  :ref:`csrf-middleware` for more information.
* ``Cake\Http\Client::addCookie()`` was added to make it easy to add cookies to
  a client instance.

InstanceConfigTrait
-------------------

* ``InstanceConfigTrait::getConfig()`` now takes a 2nd parameter ``$default``.
  If no value is available for the specified ``$key``, the ``$default`` value
  will be returned.

ORM
---

* ``Cake\ORM\Query::contain()`` now allows you to call it without the wrapping
  array when containing a single association. ``contain('Comments', function ()
  { ... });`` will now work. This makes ``contain()`` consistent with other
  eagerloading related methods like ``leftJoinWith()`` and ``matching()``.

Routing
-------

* ``Cake\Routing\Router::reverseToArray()`` was added. This method allow you to
  convert a request object into an array that can be used to generate URL
  strings.
* ``Cake\Routing\RouteBuilder::resources()`` had the ``path`` option
  added. This option lets you make the resource path and controller name not
  match.
* ``Cake\Routing\RouteBuilder`` now has methods to create routes for
  specific HTTP methods. e.g ``get()`` and ``post()``.
* ``Cake\Routing\RouteBuilder::loadPlugin()`` was added.
* ``Cake\Routing\Route`` now has fluent methods for defining options.

TestSuite
---------

* ``TestCase::loadFixtures()`` will now load all fixtures when no arguments are
  provided.
* ``IntegrationTestCase::head()`` was added.
* ``IntegrationTestCase::options()`` was added.
* ``IntegrationTestCase::disableErrorHandlerMiddleware()`` was added to make
  debugging errors easier in integration tests.

Validation
----------

* ``Cake\Validation\Validator::scalar()`` was added to ensure that fields do not
  get non-scalar data.
* ``Cake\Validation\Validator::regex()`` was added for a more convenient way
  to validate data against a regex pattern.
* ``Cake\Validation\Validator::addDefaultProvider()`` was added. This method
  lets you inject validation providers into all the validators created in your
  application.
* ``Cake\Validation\ValidatorAwareInterface`` was added to define the methods
  implemented by ``Cake\Validation\ValidatorAwareTrait``.

View
----

* ``Cake\View\Helper\PaginatorHelper::limitControl()`` was added. This method
  lets you create a form with a select box for updating the limit value on
  a paginated result set.
