Inflector
#########

.. php:class:: Inflector

The Inflector class takes a string and can manipulate it to handle
word variations such as pluralizations or camelizing and is
normally accessed statically. Example:
``Inflector::pluralize('example')`` returns "examples".

You can try out the inflections online at
`inflector.cakephp.org <https://inflector.cakephp.org/>`_.

.. php:staticmethod:: pluralize($singular)

    * **Input:** Apple, Orange, Person, Man
    * **Output:** Apples, Oranges, People, Men

.. note::

    ``pluralize()`` may not always correctly convert a noun that is already in
    it's plural form.

.. php:staticmethod:: singularize($plural)

    * **Input:** Apples, Oranges, People, Men
    * **Output:** Apple, Orange, Person, Man

.. note::

    ``singularize()`` may not always correctly convert a noun that is already in
    it's singular form.

.. php:staticmethod:: camelize($underscored)

    * **Input:** Apple\_pie, some\_thing, people\_person
    * **Output:** ApplePie, SomeThing, PeoplePerson

.. php:staticmethod:: underscore($camelCase)

    It should be noted that underscore will only convert camelCase
    formatted words. Words that contains spaces will be lower-cased,
    but will not contain an underscore.

    * **Input:** applePie, someThing
    * **Output:** apple\_pie, some\_thing

.. php:staticmethod:: humanize($underscored)

    * **Input:** apple\_pie, some\_thing, people\_person
    * **Output:** Apple Pie, Some Thing, People Person

.. php:staticmethod:: tableize($camelCase)

    * **Input:** Apple, UserProfileSetting, Person
    * **Output:** apples, user\_profile\_settings, people

.. php:staticmethod:: classify($underscored)

    * **Input:** apples, user\_profile\_settings, people
    * **Output:** Apple, UserProfileSetting, Person

.. php:staticmethod:: variable($underscored)

    * **Input:** apples, user\_result, people\_people
    * **Output:** apples, userResult, peoplePeople

.. php:staticmethod:: slug($word, $replacement = '_')

    Slug converts special characters into latin versions and converting
    unmatched characters and spaces to underscores. The slug method
    expects UTF-8 encoding.

    * **Input:** apple pur√©e
    * **Output:** apple\_puree

.. php:staticmethod:: reset()

    Resets Inflector back to its initial state, useful in testing.

.. php:staticmethod:: rules($type, $rules, $reset = false)
