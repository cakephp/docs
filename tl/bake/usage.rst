Code Generation with Bake
#########################

The cake console is run using the PHP CLI (command line interface).
If you have problems running the script, ensure that:

#. You have the PHP CLI installed and that it has the proper modules enabled (eg: MySQL, intl).
#. Users also might have issues if the database host is 'localhost' and should try '127.0.0.1' instead, as localhost can cause issues with PHP CLI.
#. Depending on how your computer is configured, you may have to set execute rights on the cake bash script to call it using ``bin/cake bake``.

Before running bake you should make sure you have at least one database
connection configured. See the section on :ref:`database configuration
<database-configuration>` for more information.

When run with no arguments ``bin/cake bake`` will output a list of available
tasks. You should see something like::

    $ bin/cake bake

    Welcome to CakePHP v3.4.6 Console
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    App : src
    Path: /var/www/cakephp.dev/src/
    PHP : 5.6.20
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    The following commands can be used to generate skeleton code for your application.

    Available bake commands:

    - all
    - behavior
    - cell
    - component
    - controller
    - fixture
    - form
    - helper
    - mailer
    - migration
    - migration_diff
    - migration_snapshot
    - model
    - plugin
    - seed
    - shell
    - shell_helper
    - task
    - template
    - test

    By using `cake bake [name]` you can invoke a specific bake task.

You can get more information on what each task does, and what options are
available using the ``--help`` option::

    $ bin/cake bake --help

    Welcome to CakePHP v3.4.6 Console

    The Bake script generates controllers, models and template files for
    your application. If run with no command line arguments, Bake guides the
    user through the class creation process. You can customize the
    generation process by telling Bake where different parts of your
    application are using command line arguments.

    Usage:
    cake bake.bake [subcommand] [options]

    Subcommands:

    all                 Bake a complete MVC skeleton.
    behavior            Bake a behavior class file.

    controller          Bake a controller skeleton.
    fixture             Generate fixtures for use with the test suite. You

    form                Bake a form class file.
    helper              Bake a helper class file.

template files used when baking. To create your own templates, see the
:ref:`bake theme creation documentation <creating-a-bake-theme>`.
