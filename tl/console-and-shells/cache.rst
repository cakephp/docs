Cache Shell
===========

To help you better manage cached data from a CLI environment, a shell command
is available for clearing cached data your application has::

    // Clear one cache config
    bin/cake cache clear <configname>

    // Clear all cache configs
    bin/cake cache clear_all

.. versionadded:: 3.3.0
    The cache shell was added in 3.3.0
